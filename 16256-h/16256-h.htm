<h3>DESCRIPTION AND GENERAL OUTLINE OF</h3>
<p><b>Definition of Psychology of Management.</b> &mdash; The
Psychology of Management, as here used, means, &mdash; the effect
of the mind that is directing work upon that work which is
directed, and the effect of this undirected and directed work upon
the mind of the worker.</p>
<p><b>Importance of the Subject.</b> &mdash; Before defining the
terms that will be used more in detail, and outlining the method of
treatment to be followed, it is well to consider the importance of
the subject matter of this book, for upon the reader's interest in
the subject, and his desire, from the outset, to follow what is
said, and to respond to it, rests a large part of the value of this
book.</p>
<p><b>Value of Psychology.</b> &mdash; First of all, then, what is
there in the subject of psychology to demand the attention of the
manager?</p>
<p>Psychology, in the popular phrase, is "the study of the mind."
It has for years been included in the training of all teachers, and
has been one of the first steps for the student of philosophy; but
it has not, usually, been included among the studies of the young
<!--Page 002--><a name="P002" id="P002"></a> scientific or
engineering student, or of any students in other lines than
Philosophy and Education. This, not because its value as a "culture
subject" was not understood, but because the course of the average
student is so crowded with technical preparation necessary to his
life work, and because the practical value of psychology has not
been recognized. It is well recognized that the teacher must
understand the working of the mind in order best to impart his
information in that way that will enable the student to grasp it
most readily. It was not recognized that every man going out into
the world needs all the knowledge that he can get as to the working
of the human mind in order not only to give but to receive
information with the least waste and expenditure of energy, nor was
it recognized that in the industrial, as well as the academic
world, almost every man is a teacher.</p>
<p><b>Value of Management.</b> &mdash; The second question
demanding attention is; &mdash; Of what value is the study of
management?</p>
<p>The study of management has been omitted from the student's
training until comparatively recently, for a very different reason
than was psychology. It was never doubted that a knowledge of
management would be of great value to anyone and everyone, and many
were the queer schemes for obtaining that knowledge after
graduation. It was doubted that management could be studied
otherwise than by observation and practice. <a href=
"#ch01fn01"><sup>1</sup></a> Few teachers, if any, believed in the
existence, or possibility, of a teaching <!--Page 003--><a name=
"P003" id="P003"></a> science of management. Management was
assumed by many to be an art, by even more it was thought to be a
divinely bestowed gift or talent, rather than an acquired
accomplishment. It was common belief that one could learn to manage
only by going out on the work and watching other managers, or by
trying to manage, and not by studying about management in a class
room or in a text book; that watching a good manager might help
one, but no one could hope really to succeed who had not "the knack
born in him."</p>
<p>With the advent of "Scientific Management," and its
demonstration that the best management is founded on laws that have
been determined, and can be taught, the study of management in the
class room as well as on the work became possible and
actual.<a href="#ch01fn02"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Value of Psychology of Management.</b> &mdash; Third, we must
consider the value of the study of the psychology of
management.<a href="#ch01fn03"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>This question, like the one that precedes it, is answered by
Scientific Management. It has demonstrated that the emphasis in
successful management lies on the <i>man</i>, not on the
<i>work</i>; that efficiency is best secured by placing the
emphasis on the man, and modifying the equipment, materials and
methods to make the most of the man. It has, further, recognized
that the man's mind is a controlling factor in his efficiency, and
has, by teaching, enabled <!--Page 004--><a name="P004" id=
"P004"></a> the man to make the most of his powers. <a href=
"#ch01fn04"><sup>4</sup></a> In order to understand this teaching
element that is such a large part of management, a knowledge of
psychology is imperative; and this study of psychology, as it
applies to the work of the manager or the managed, is exactly what
the "psychology of management" is.</p>
<p><b>Five Indications of This Value.</b> &mdash; In order to
realize the importance of the psychology of management it is
necessary to consider the following five points: &mdash;</p>
<p>1. Management is a life study of every man who works with other
men. He must either manage, or be managed, or both; in any case, he
can never work to best advantage until he understands both the
psychological and managerial laws by which he governs or is
governed.</p>
<p>2. A knowledge of the underlying laws of management is the most
important asset that one can carry with him into his life work,
even though he will never manage any but himself. It is useful,
practical, commercially valuable.</p>
<p>3. This knowledge is to be had <i>now</i>. The men who have it
are ready and glad to impart it to all who are interested and who
will pass it on.<a href="#ch01fn05"><sup>5</sup></a> The text books
are at hand now. The opportunities for practical experience in
Scientific Management will meet all demands as fast as they are
made.</p>
<p>4. The psychology of, that is, the mind's
<!--Page 005--><a name="P005" id="P005"></a> place in management
is only one part, element or variable of management; one of
numerous, almost numberless, variables.</p>
<p>5. It is a division well fitted to occupy the attention of the
beginner, as well as the more experienced, because it is a most
excellent place to start the study of management. A careful study
of the relations of psychology to management should develop in the
student a method of attack in learning his selected life work that
should help him to grasp quickly the orderly array of facts that
the other variables, as treated by the great managers, bring to
him.</p>
<p><b>Purpose of This Book.</b> &mdash; It is scarcely necessary to
mention that this book can hope to do little more than arouse an
interest in the subject and point the way to the detailed books
where such an interest can be more deeply aroused and more fully
satisfied.</p>
<p><b>What This Book Will Not Do.</b> &mdash; It is not the purpose
of this book to give an exhaustive treatment of psychology. Neither
is it possible in this book to attempt to give a detailed account
of management in general, or of the Taylor plan of "Scientific
Management" so-called, in particular. All of the literature on the
subject has been carefully studied and reviewed for the purpose of
writing this book, &mdash; not only what is in print, but
considerable that is as yet in manuscript. No statement has been
made that is not along the line of the accepted thought and
standardized practice of the authorities. The foot notes have been
prepared with great care. By reading <!--Page 006--><a name="P006"
id="P006"></a> the references there given one can verify
statements in the text, and can also, if he desires, inform himself
at length on any branch of the subject that especially interests
him.</p>
<p><b>What This Book Will Do.</b> &mdash; This book aims not so
much to instruct as to arouse an interest in its subject, and to
point the way whence instruction comes. If it can serve as an
introduction to psychology and to management, can suggest the
relation of these two fields of inquiries and can ultimately enroll
its readers as investigators in a resultant great field of inquiry,
it will have accomplished its aim.</p>
<p><b>Definition of Management.</b> &mdash; To discuss this subject
more in detail &mdash;</p>
<p>First: What is "Management"?</p>
<p>"Management," as defined by the Century Dictionary, is "the art
of managing by direction or regulation."</p>
<p>Successful management of the old type was an art based on no
measurement. Scientific Management is an art based upon a science,
&mdash; upon laws deducted from measurement. Management continues
to be what it has always been, &mdash; the <i>art</i> of directing
activity.</p>
<p><b>Change in the Accepted Meaning.</b> &mdash; "Management,"
until recent years, and the emphasis placed on Scientific
Management was undoubtedly associated, in the average mind, with
the <i>managing</i> part of the organization only, neglecting that
vital part &mdash; the best interests of the managed, almost
entirely. Since we have come to realize that management signifies
the relationship between the managing <!--Page 007--><a name="P007"
id="P007"></a> and the managed in doing work, a new realization
of its importance has come about. <a href=
"#ch01fn06"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Inadequacy of the Terms Used</b>. &mdash; It is unfortunate
that the English language is so poor in synonyms in this field that
the same word must have two such different and conflicting
meanings, for, though the new definition of management be accepted,
the "Fringe" of associations that belong to the old are apt to
remain.<a href="#ch01fn07"><sup>7</sup></a> The thoughts of "knack,
aptitude, tact, adroitness," &mdash; not to speak of the less
desirable "Brute Force," "shrewdness, subtlety, cunning, artifice,
deceit, duplicity," of the older idea of management remain in the
background of the mind and make it difficult, even when one is
convinced that management is a science, to think and act as if it
were.</p>
<p>It must be noticed and constantly remembered that one of the
greatest difficulties to overcome in studying management and its
development is the meaning of the terms used. It is most
unfortunate that the new ideas have been forced to content
themselves with old forms as best they may.</p>
<p><b>Psychological Interest of the Terms</b>. &mdash; Psychology
could ask no more interesting subject than a study of the mental
processes that lie back of many of these terms. It is most
unfortunate for the obtaining of clearness, that new terms were not
invented for the new ideas. There is, however, an excellent reason
for using the old terms. By their use it is emphasized that the new
thought is a logical outgrowth <!--Page 008--><a name="P008" id=
"P008"></a> of the old, and experience has proved that this
close relationship to established ideas is a powerful argument for
the new science; but such terms as "task," "foreman," "speed boss,"
"piece-rate" and "bonus," as used in the science of management,
suffer from misunderstanding caused by old and now false
associations. Furthermore, in order to compare old and new
interpretations of the ideas of management, the older terms of
management should have their traditional meanings only. The two
sets of meanings are a source of endless confusion, unwarranted
prejudice, and worse. This is well recognized by the authorities on
Management.</p>
<p><b>The Three Types of Management.</b> &mdash; We note this
inadequacy of terms again when we discuss the various <i>types</i>
of Management.</p>
<p>We may divide all management into three types &mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Traditional</p>
<p>(2) Transitory</p>
<p>(3) Scientific, or measured functional. <a href=
"#ch01fn08"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Traditional Management, the first, has been variously called
"Military," "Driver," the "Marquis of Queensberry type,"
"Initiative and Incentive Management," as well as "Traditional"
management.</p>
<p><b>Definition of the First Type.</b> &mdash; In the first type,
the power of managing lies, theoretically at least, in the hands of
one man, a capable "all-around" manager. The line of authority and
of responsibility is clear, fixed and single. Each man comes in
direct contact with but one man above him. A man may or may not
manage more than one man beneath him, <!--Page 009--><a name="P009"
id="P009"></a> but, however this may be, he is managed by but
one man above him.</p>
<p><b>Preferable Name for the First Type.</b> &mdash; The names
"Traditional," or "Initiative and Incentive," are the preferable
titles for this form of management. It is true they lack in
specificness, but the other names, while aiming to be descriptive,
really emphasize one feature only, and in some cases with
unfortunate results.</p>
<p><b>The Name "Military" Inadvisable.</b> &mdash; The direct line
of authority suggested the name "Military," <a href=
"#ch01fn09"><sup>9</sup></a> and at the time of the adoption of
that name it was probably appropriate as well as
complimentary.<a href="#ch01fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> Appropriate in
the respect referred to only, for the old type of management varied
so widely in its manifestations that the comparison to the
procedure of the Army was most inaccurate. "Military" has always
been a synonym for "systematized", "orderly," "definite," while the
old type of management was more often quite the opposite of the
meaning of all these terms. The term "Military Management" though
often used in an uncomplimentary sense would, today, if understood,
be more complimentary than ever it was in the past. The
introduction of various features of Scientific Management into the
Army and Navy, &mdash; and such features are being incorporated
steadily and constantly, &mdash; is raising the standard of
management there to a high degree. <!--Page010--><a name="P010" id=
"P010"></a> This but renders the name "Military" Management for
the old type more inaccurate and misleading.</p>
<p>It is plain that the stirring associations of the word
"military" make its use for the old type, by advocates of the old
type, a weapon against Scientific Management that only the careful
thinker can turn aside.</p>
<p><b>The Names "Driver" and "Marquis of Queensberry"
Unfortunate.</b> &mdash; The name "Driver" suggests an opposition
between the managers and the men, an opposition which the term
"Marquis of Queensberry" emphasizes. This term "Marquis of
Queensberry" has been given to that management which is thought of
as a mental and physical contest, waged "according to the rules of
the game." These two names are most valuable pictorially, or in
furnishing oratorical material. They are constant reminders of the
constant desire of the managers to get all the work that is
possible out of the men, but they are scarcely descriptive in any
satisfactory sense, and the visions they summon, while they are
perhaps definite, are certainly, for the inexperienced in
management, inaccurate. In other words, they usually lead to
imagination rather than to perception.</p>
<p><b>The Name "Initiative and Incentive" Authoritative.</b>
&mdash; The term "Initiative and Incentive" is used by Dr. Taylor,
and is fully described by him. <a href=
"#ch01fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> The words themselves suggest, truly,
that he gives the old form of management its due. He does more than
this. He points out in his definition of the terms the likenesses
between the old and new forms.</p>
<!--Page011--><a name="P011" id="P011"></a>
<p><b>The Name "Traditional" Brief and Descriptive</b>. &mdash; The
only excuses for the term "Traditional," since Dr. Taylor's term is
available, are its brevity and its descriptiveness. The fact that
it is indefinite is really no fault in it, as the subject it
describes is equally indefinite. The "fringe" <a href=
"#ch01fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> of this word is especially good. It
calls up ideas of information handed down from generation to
generation orally, the only way of teaching under the old type of
management. It recalls the idea of the inaccurate perpetuation of
unthinking custom, and the "myth" element always present in
tradition, &mdash; again undeniable accusations against the old
type of management. The fundamental idea of the tradition, that it
is <i>oral</i>, is the essence of the difference of the old type of
management from science, or even system, which must be written.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to make more definite here the content of
this oldest type of management, rather being satisfied with the
extent, and accepting for working use the name "Traditional" with
the generally accepted definition of that name.</p>
<p><b>Definition of the Second Type of Management</b>. &mdash; The
second type of management is called "Interim" or "Transitory"
management. It includes all management that is consciously passing
into Scientific Management and embraces all stages, from management
that has incorporated one scientifically derived principle, to
management that has adopted all but one such principle.</p>
<p><b>Preferable Name for Second Type of Management.</b>
<!--Page012--><a name="P012" id="P012"></a> &mdash; Perhaps the
name "Transitory" is slightly preferable in that, though the
element of temporariness is present in both words, it is more
strongly emphasized in the latter. The usual habit of associating
with it the ideas of "fleeting, evanescent, ephemeral, momentary,
short-lived," may have an influence on hastening the completion of
the installing of Scientific Management.</p>
<p><b>Definition of the Third Type of Management.</b> &mdash; The
third form of management is called "Ultimate," "measured
Functional," or "Scientific," management, and might also be called,
&mdash; but for the objection of Dr. Taylor, the "Taylor Plan of
Management." This differs from the first two types mentioned in
that it is a definite plan of management synthesized from
scientific analysis of the data of management. In other words,
Scientific Management is that management which is a science, i.e.,
which operates according to known, formulated, and applied
laws.<a href="#ch01fn13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Preferable Name of the Third Type of Management.</b> &mdash;
The name "Ultimate" has, especially to the person operating under
the transitory stage, all the charm and inspiration of a goal. It
has all the incentives to accomplishment of a clearly circumscribed
task. Its very definiteness makes it seem possible of attainment.
It is a great satisfaction to one who, during a lifetime of
managing effort, has tried one offered improvement after another to
be convinced that he has found the right road at last. The name
<!--Page013--><a name="P013" id="P013"></a> is, perhaps, of
greatest value in attracting the attention of the uninformed and,
as the possibilities of the subject can fulfill the most exacting
demands, the attention once secured can be held.</p>
<p>The name "measured functional" is the most descriptive, but
demands the most explanation. The principle of functionalization is
one of the underlying, fundamental principles of Scientific
Management. It is not as necessary to stop to define it here, as it
is necessary to discuss the definition, the principle, and the
underlying psychology, at length later.</p>
<p>The name "scientific" while in some respects not as appropriate
as are any of the other names, has already received the stamp of
popular approval. In derivation it is beyond criticism. It also
describes exactly, as has been said, the difference between the
older forms of management and the new. Even its "fringe" of
association is, or at least was when first used, all that could be
desired; but the name is, unfortunately, occasionally used
indiscriminately for any sort of system and for schemes of
operation that are not based on time study. It has gradually become
identified more or less closely with</p>
<p>1. the Taylor Plan of Management</p>
<p>2. what we have defined as the "Transitory" plan of
management</p>
<p>3. management which not only is not striving to be scientific,
but which confounds "science" with "system." Both its advocates and
opponents have been guilty of misuse of the word. Still, in spite
of this, the very fact that the word has had a wide use, that it
has become habitual to think of the new type
<!--Page 014--><a name="P014" id="P014"></a> of management as
"Scientific," makes its choice advisable. We shall use it, but
restrict its content. With us "Scientific Management" is used to
mean the complete Taylor plan of management, with no modifications
and no deviations.</p>
<p>We may summarize by saying that:</p>
<p>1. the popular name is Scientific Management,</p>
<p>2. the inspiring name is Ultimate management,</p>
<p>3. the descriptive name is measured Functional management,</p>
<p>4. the distinctive name is the Taylor Plan of Management.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this book, Scientific Management is, then,
the most appropriate name. Through its use, the reader is enabled
to utilize all his associations, and through his study he is able
to restrict and order the content of the term.</p>
<p><b>Relationship Between the Three Types of Management.</b>
&mdash; From the foregoing definitions and descriptions it will be
clear that the three types of management are closely related. Three
of the names given bring out this relationship most clearly. These
are Traditional (i.e., Primitive), Interim, and Ultimate. These
show, also, that the relationship is genetic, i.e., that the second
form grows out of the first, but passes through to the third. The
growth is evolutional.</p>
<p>Under the first type, or in the first stage of management, the
laws or principles underlying right management are usually unknown,
hence disregarded.</p>
<p>In the second stage, the laws are known and installed as fast as
functional foremen can be taught <!--Page 015--><a name="P015" id=
"P015"></a> their new duties and the resistances of human nature
can be overcome.<a href="#ch01fn14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In the third stage the managing is operated in accordance with
the recognized laws of management.</p>
<p><b>Psychological Significance of This Relationship.</b> &mdash;
The importance of the knowledge and of the desire for it can
scarcely be overestimated. This again makes plain the value of the
psychological study of management.</p>
<p><b>Possible Psychological Studies of Management.</b> &mdash; In
making this psychological study of management, it would be possible
to take up the three types as defined above, separately and in
order, and to discuss the place of the mind in each, at length; but
such a method would not only result in needless repetition, but
also in most difficult comparisons when final results were to be
deduced and formulated.</p>
<p>It would, again, be possible to take up the various elements or
divisions of psychological study as determined by a consensus of
psychologists, and to illustrate each in turn from the three types
of management; but the results from any such method would be apt to
seem unrelated and impractical, i.e., it would be a lengthy process
to get results that would be of immediate, practical use in
managing.</p>
<p><b>Plan of Psychological Study Used Here.</b> &mdash; It has,
therefore, seemed best to base the discussion that is to follow
upon arbitrary divisions of scientific management, that is
&mdash;</p>
<!--Page 016--><a name="P016" id="P016"></a>
<p>1. To enumerate the underlying principles on which scientific
management rests.</p>
<p>2. To show in how far the other two types of management vary
from Scientific Management.</p>
<p>3. To discuss the psychological aspect of each principle.</p>
<p><b>Advantages of This Plan of Study.</b> &mdash; In this way the
reader can gain an idea of</p>
<p>1. The relation of Scientific Management to the other types of
management.</p>
<p>2. The structure of Scientific Management.</p>
<p>3. The relation between the various elements of Scientific
Management.</p>
<p>4. The psychology of management in general, and of the three
types of management in particular.</p>
<p><b>Underlying Ideas and Divisions of Scientific Management.</b>
&mdash; These underlying ideas are grouped under nine divisions, as
follows: &mdash;</p>
<p>1. Individuality.</p>
<p>2. Functionalization.</p>
<p>3. Measurement.</p>
<p>4. Analysis and Synthesis.</p>
<p>5. Standardization.</p>
<p>6. Records and Programmes.</p>
<p>7. Teaching.</p>
<p>8. Incentives.</p>
<p>9. Welfare.</p>
<p>It is here only necessary to enumerate these divisions. Each
will be made the subject of a chapter.</p>
<p><b>Derivation of These Divisions.</b> &mdash; These divisions
lay no claim to being anything but underlying ideas of Scientific
Management, that embrace varying numbers <!--Page 017--><a name=
"P017" id="P017"></a> of established elements that can easily be
subjected to the scrutiny of psychological investigation.</p>
<p>The discussion will be as little technical as is possible, will
take nothing for granted and will cite references at every step.
This is a new field of investigation, and the utmost care is
necessary to avoid generalizing from insufficient data.</p>
<p><b>Derivation of Scientific Management.</b> &mdash; There has
been much speculation as to the age and origin of Scientific
Management. The results of this are interesting, but are not of
enough practical value to be repeated here. Many ideas of
Scientific Management can be traced back, more or less clearly and
directly, to thinkers of the past; but the Science of Management,
as such, was discovered, and the deduction of its laws, or
"principles," made possible when Dr. Frederick W. Taylor discovered
and applied Time Study. Having discovered this, he constructed from
it and the other fundamental principles a complete whole.</p>
<p>Mr. George Iles in that most interesting and instructive of
books, "Inventors at Work," <a href="#ch01fn15"><sup>15</sup></a>
has pointed out the importance, to development in any line of
progress or science, of measuring devices and methods.
Contemporaneous with, or previous to, the discovery of the device
or method, must come the discovery or determination of the most
profitable unit of measurement which will, of itself, best show the
variations in efficiency from class. When Dr. Taylor discovered
units of measurement for determining, <i>prior to performance</i>,
the amount of any kind of <!--Page 018--><a name="P018" id=
"P018"></a> work that a worker could do and the amount of rest
he must have during the performance of that work, then, and not
until then, did management become a science. On this hangs the
science of management.<a href="#ch01fn16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Outline of Method of Investigation.</b> &mdash; In the
discussion of each of the nine divisions of Scientific Management,
the following topics must be treated:</p>
<p>1. Definition of the division and its underlying idea.</p>
<p>2. Appearance and importance of the idea in Traditional and
Transitory Management.</p>
<p>3. Appearance and importance of the idea in Scientific
Management.</p>
<p>4. Elements of Scientific Management which show the effects of
the idea.</p>
<p>5. Results of the idea upon work and workers.</p>
<p>These topics will be discussed in such order as the particular
division investigated demands. The psychological significance of
the appearance or non-appearance of the idea, and of the effect of
the idea, will be noted. The results will be summarized at the
close of each chapter, in order to furnish data for drawing
conclusions at the close of the discussion.</p>
<p><b>Conclusions to be Reached.</b> &mdash; These conclusions will
include the following: &mdash;</p>
<p>&ensp;1. "Scientific Management" is a science.</p>
<p>&ensp;2. It alone, of the Three Types of Management, is a
science.</p>
<p>&ensp;3. Contrary to a widespread belief that Scientific
Management kills individuality, it is built on the basic
<!--Page 019--><a name="P019" id="P019"></a> principle of
recognition of the individual, not only as an economic unit but
also as a personality, with all the idiosyncrasies that distinguish
a person.</p>
<p>&ensp;4. Scientific Management fosters individuality by
functionalizing work.</p>
<p>&ensp;5. Measurement, in Scientific Management, is of ultimate
units of subdivision.</p>
<p>&ensp;6. These measured ultimate units are combined into methods
of least waste.</p>
<p>&ensp;7. Standardization under Scientific Management applies to
all elements.</p>
<p>&ensp;8. The accurate records of Scientific Management make
accurate programmes possible of fulfillment.</p>
<p>&ensp;9. Through the teaching of Scientific Management the
management is unified and made self-perpetuating.</p>
<p>10. The method of teaching of Scientific Management is a
distinct and valuable contribution to Education.</p>
<p>11. Incentives under Scientific Management not only stimulate
but benefit the worker.</p>
<p>12. It is for the ultimate as well as immediate welfare of the
worker to work under Scientific Management.</p>
<p>13. Scientific Management is applicable to all fields of
activity, and to mental as well as physical work.</p>
<p>14. Scientific Management is applicable to self-management as
well as to managing others.</p>
<p>15. It teaches men to co&ouml;perate with the management as well
as to manage. <!--Page 020--><a name="P020" id="P020"></a></p>
<p>16. It is a device capable of use by all.</p>
<p>17. The psychological element of Scientific Management is the
most important element.</p>
<p>18. Because Scientific Management is psychologically right it is
the ultimate form of management.</p>
<p>19. This psychological study of Scientific Management emphasizes
especially the teaching features.</p>
<p>20. Scientific Management simultaneously</p>
<p class="ltritem">a. increases output and wages and lowers
costs.</p>
<p class="ltritem">b. eliminates waste.</p>
<p class="ltritem">c. turns unskilled labor into skilled.</p>
<p class="ltritem">d. provides a system of self-perpetuating
welfare.</p>
<p class="ltritem">e. reduces the cost of living.</p>
<p class="ltritem">f. bridges the gap between the college trained
and the apprenticeship trained worker.</p>
<p class="ltritem">g. forces capital and labor to co&ouml;perate
and to promote industrial peace.</p>

<h3><a name="chapterii" id="chapterii">CHAPTER II</a></h3>
<h3>INDIVIDUALITY</h3>
<p><b>Definition of Individuality.</b> &mdash; "An individual is a
single thing, a being that is, or is regarded as, a unit. An
individual is opposed to a crowd. Individual action is opposed to
associate action. Individual interests are opposed to common or
community interests." These definitions give us some idea of the
extent of individuality. Individuality is a particular or
distinctive characteristic of an individual; "that quality or
aggregate of qualities which distinguishes one person or thing from
another, idiosyncrasy." This indicates the content.</p>
<p>For our purpose, we may define the study of individuality as a
consideration of the individual as a unit with special
characteristics. That it is a <i>unit</i> signifies that it is one
of many and that it has likeness to the many. That it has
<i>special characteristics</i> shows that it is one of many, but
different from the many. This consideration of individuality
emphasizes both the common element and the diverging
characteristics.</p>
<p><b>Individuality as Treated in This Chapter.</b> &mdash; The
recognition of individuality is the subject of this chapter. The
utilization of this individuality in its deviation
<!--Page 022--><a name="P022" id="P022"></a> from class, is the
subject of the chapter that follows, Functionalization.</p>
<p><b>Individuality as Considered by Psychology.</b> &mdash;
Psychology has not always emphasized the importance of the
individual as a unit for study. Prof. Ladd's definition of
psychology, quoted and endorsed by Prof. James, is "the description
and explanation of states of consciousness, as such." <a href=
"#ch02fn01"><sup>1</sup></a> "By states of consciousness," says
James, "are meant such things as sensation, desires, emotions,
cognitions, reasonings, decisions, volitions, and the like." This
puts the emphasis on such divisions of consciousness as,
"attention," "interest," and "will."</p>
<p>With the day of experimental psychology has come the importance
of the individual self as a subject of study, <a href=
"#ch02fn02"><sup>2</sup></a> and psychology has come to be defined,
as Calkins defines it, as a "science of the self as conscious."
<a href="#ch02fn03"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>We hear much in the talk of today of the "psychology of the
crowd," the "psychology of the mob," and the "psychology of the
type," etc., but the mind that is being measured, and from whose
measurements the laws are being deduced and formulated is, at the
present the <i>individual</i> mind. <a href=
"#ch02fn04"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The psychology which interested itself particularly in studying
such divisions of mental activity as attention, will, habit, etc.,
emphasizes more particularly the likenesses of minds. It is
necessary to understand <!--Page 023--><a name="P023" id=
"P023"></a> thoroughly all of these likenesses before one can be
sure what the differences, or idiosyncrasies, are, and how
important they are, because, while the likenesses furnish the
background, it is the differences that are most often actually
utilized by management. These must be determined in order to
compute and set the proper individual task for the given man from
standard data of the standard, or first-class man.</p>
<p>In any study of the individual, the following facts must be
noted: &mdash;</p>
<p>1. The importance of the study of the individual, and the
comparatively small amount of work that has as yet been done in
that field.</p>
<p>2. The difficulty of the study, and the necessity for great
care, not only in the study itself, but in deducing laws from
it.</p>
<p>3. The necessity of considering any one individual trait as
modified by all the other traits of the individual.</p>
<p>4. The importance of the individual as distinct from the
type.</p>
<p>Many students are so interested in studying types and deducing
laws which apply to types in general, that they lose sight of the
fact that the individual is the basis of the study, &mdash; that
individuality is that for which they must seek and for which they
must constantly account. As Sully says, we must not emphasize
"<i>typical developments</i> in a new individual," at the expense
of "typical development <i>in a new individual</i>." <a href=
"#ch02fn05"><sup>5</sup></a> It is the fact that the development
<!--Page 024--><a name="P024" id="P024"></a> occurs in an
individual, and not that the development is typical, that we should
emphasize.</p>
<p><b>Individuality Seldom Recognized Under Traditional
Management.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional Management there was
little or no systematized method for the recognition of
individuality or individual fitness. <a href=
"#ch02fn06"><sup>6</sup></a> The worker usually was, in the mind of
the manager, one of a crowd, his only distinguishing mark being the
amount of work which he was capable of performing.</p>
<p><b>Selecting Workers Under Traditional Management.</b> &mdash;
In selecting men to do work, there was little or no attempt to
study the individuals who applied for work. The matter of selection
was more of a process of "guess work" than of exact measurement,
and the highest form of test was considered to be that of having
the man actually tried out by being given a chance at the work
itself. There was not only a great waste of time on the work,
because men unfitted to it could not turn it out so successfully,
but there also was a waste of the worker, and many times a positive
injury to the worker, by his being put at work which he was
unfitted either to perform, to work at continuously, or both.</p>
<p>In the most progressive type of Traditional Management there was
usually a feeling, however, that if the labor market offered even
temporarily a greater supply than the work in hand demanded, it was
wise to choose those men to do the work who were best fitted for
it, or who were willing to work for less wages. It is surprising to
find in the traditional type, <!--Page 025--><a name="P025" id=
"P025"></a> even up to the present day, how often men were
selected for their strength and physique, rather than for any
special capabilities fitting them for working in, or at, the
particular line of work to be done.</p>
<p><b>Output Seldom Separated Under Traditional Management.</b>
&mdash; Under Traditional Management especially on day work the
output of the men was not usually separated, nor was the output
recorded separately, as can be done even with the work of
gangs.</p>
<p><b>Few Individual Tasks Under Traditional Management.</b>
&mdash; Seldom, if ever, was an individual task set for a worker on
day work, or piece work, and even if one were set, it was not
scientifically determined. The men were simply set to work alone or
in gangs, <i>as the work demanded</i>, and if the foreman was
overworked or lazy, allowed to take practically their own time to
do the work. If, on the other hand, the foreman was a "good
driver," the men might be pushed to their utmost limit of their
individual undirected speed, regardless of their welfare.</p>
<p><b>Little Individual Teaching Under Traditional Management.</b>
&mdash; Not having a clear idea either of the present fitness and
the future possibilities of the worker, or the requirements of the
work, no intelligent attempt could be made at efficient individual
teaching. What teaching was done was in the form of directions for
all, concerning the work in general, the directions being given by
an overworked foreman, the holding of whose position often depended
more upon whether his employer made money than upon the way his men
were taught, or worked.</p>
<!--Page 026--><a name="P026" id="P026"></a>
<p><b>Seldom an Individual Reward Under Traditional Management.</b>
&mdash; As a typical example of disregard of individuality, the
worker in the household may be cited, and especially the "general
housework girl." Selected with no knowledge of her capabilities,
and with little or no scientific or even systematized knowledge of
the work that she is expected to do, there is little or no thought
of a prescribed and definite task, no teaching specially adapted to
the individual needs of the taught, and no reward in proportion to
efficiency.</p>
<p><b>Cause of These Lacks Under Traditional Management.</b>
&mdash; The fault lies not in any desire of the managers to do poor
or wasteful work, or to treat their workers unfairly, &mdash; but
in a lack of knowledge and of accurate methods for obtaining,
conserving and transmitting knowledge. Under Traditional Management
no one individual knows precisely what is to be done. Such
management seldom knows how work could best be done; &mdash; never
knows how much work each individual can do. <a href=
"#ch02fn07"><sup>7</sup></a> Understanding neither work nor
workers, it can not adjust the one to the other so as to obtain
least waste. Having no conception of the importance of accurate
measurement, it has no thought of the individual as a unit.</p>
<p><b>Individuality Recognized Under Transitory Management.</b>
&mdash; Recognition of individuality is one of the principles first
apparent under Transitory Management.</p>
<p>This is apt to demonstrate itself first of all in causing the
outputs of the workers to "show up" separately,
<!--Page 027--><a name="P027" id="P027"></a> rewarding these
separated outputs, and rewarding each worker for his individual
output.</p>
<p><b>Benefits of This Recognition</b>. &mdash; The benefits of
introducing these features first are that the worker, (1) seeing
his individual output, is stimulated to measure it, and (2)
receiving compensation in accordance with his output, is satisfied;
and (3) observing that records are necessary to determine the
amount of output and pay, is glad to have accurate measurement and
the other features of Scientific Management introduced.</p>
<p><b>Individuality a Fundamental Principle of Scientific
Management</b>. &mdash; Under Scientific Management the individual
is the unit to be measured. Functionalization is based upon
utilizing the particular powers and special abilities of each man.
Measurement is of the individual man and his work. Analysis and
synthesis build up methods by which the individual can best do his
work. Standards are of the work of an individual, a standard man,
and the task is always for an individual, being that percentage of
the standard man's task that the particular individual can do.
Records are of individuals, and are made in order to show and
reward individual effort. Specific individuals are taught those
things that they, individually, require. Incentives are individual
both in the cases of rewards and punishments, and, finally, it is
the welfare of the individual worker that is considered, without
the sacrifice of any for the good of the whole.</p>
<p><b>Individuality Considered in Selecting Workers</b>. &mdash;
Under Scientific Management individuality is considered
<!--Page 028--><a name="P028" id="P028"></a> in selecting
workers as it could not be under either of the other two forms of
management. This for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. The work is more specialized, hence requires more carefully
selected men.</p>
<p>2. With standardized methods comes a knowledge to the managers
of the qualifications of the "standard men" who can best do the
work and continuously thrive.</p>
<p>3. Motion study, in its investigation of the worker, supplies a
list of variations in workers that can be utilized in selecting
men.<a href="#ch02fn08"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Variables of the Worker.</b> &mdash; This list now includes
at least 50 or 60 variables, and shows the possible elements which
may demand consideration. When it is remembered that the individual
selected may need a large or small proportion of most of the
variables in order to do his particular work most successfully, and
that every single one of these variables, as related to the others,
may, in some way affect his output and his welfare in doing his
assigned work, the importance of taking account of individuality in
selection is apparent.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Needs Support in Studying Workers.</b>
&mdash; The best of management is by no means at its ultimate stage
in practice in this field. This, not because of a lack in the laws
of management, but because, so far, Scientific Management has not
received proper support from other lines of activity.</p>
<p><b>Present Lack of Knowledge of Applicants.</b> &mdash; At
present, the men who apply to the Industries for positions
<!--Page 029--><a name="P029" id="P029"></a> have no
scientifically determined idea of their own capabilities, neither
has there been any effort in the training or experience of most of
those who apply for work for the first time to show them how fit
they really are to do the work which they wish to do.</p>
<p><b>Supplements Demanded by Scientific Management.</b> &mdash;
Before the worker can be scientifically selected so that his
individuality can be appreciated, Scientific Management must be
supplemented in two ways: &mdash;</p>
<p>1. By psychological and physiological study of workers under it.
By such study of the effect of various kinds of standardized work
upon the mind and body, standard requirements for men who desire to
do the work can be made.</p>
<p>2. By scientific study of the worker made before he comes into
the Industries, the results of which shall show his capabilities
and possibilities.<a href="#ch02fn09"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Whence This Help Must Come.</b> &mdash; This study must be
made</p>
<p>a. In the Vocational Guidance Work.</p>
<p>b. In the Academic Work, and in both fields psychological and
physiological investigations are called for.</p>
<p><b>Work of Vocational Guidance Bureaus.</b> &mdash; Vocational
Guidance Bureaus are, at present, doing a wonderful work in their
line. This work divides itself into two parts:</p>
<p>1. Determining the capabilities of the boy, that is,
<!--Page 030--><a name="P030" id="P030"></a> seeing what he is,
by nature and training, best fitted to do.</p>
<p>2. Determining the possibilities of his securing work in the
line where he is best fitted to work, that is, studying the
industrial opportunities that offer, and the "welfare" of the
worker under each, using the word welfare in the broadest sense, of
general wellbeing, mental, physical, moral and financial.</p>
<p><b>Work of Academic World.</b> &mdash; The Academic World is
also, wherever it is progressive, attempting to study the student,
and to develop him so that he can be the most efficient individual.
Progressive educators realize that schools and colleges must stand
or fall, as efficient, as the men they train become successful or
unsuccessful in their vocations, as well as in their personal
culture.</p>
<p><b>Need for Psychological Study in All Fields.</b> &mdash; In
both these complementary lines of activity, as in Scientific
Management itself, the need for psychological study is
evident.<a href="#ch02fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> Through it, only, can
scientific progress come. Here is emphasized again the importance
of measurement. Through accurate measurement of the mind and the
body only can individuality be recognized, conserved and developed
as it should be.</p>
<p><b>Preparedness of Experimental Psychology.</b> &mdash;
Experimental psychology has instruments of precision with which to
measure and test the minds and bodies brought to it, and its
leading exponents are so broadening the scope of its activities
that it is ready and glad to plan for investigations.</p>
<!--Page 031--><a name="P031" id="P031"></a>
<p><b>Method of Selection Under Ultimate Management.</b> &mdash;
Under Ultimate Management, the minds of the workers, &mdash; and of
the managers too, &mdash; will have been studied, and the results
recorded from earliest childhood. This record, made by trained
investigators, will enable vocational guidance directors to tell
the child what he is fitted to be, and thus to help the schools and
colleges to know how best to train him, that is to say, to provide
what he will need to know to do his life work, and also those
cultural studies that his vocational work may lack, and that may be
required to build out his best development as an individual.</p>
<p>It is not always recognized that even the student who can afford
to postpone his technical training until he has completed a general
culture course, requires that his culture course be carefully
planned. Not only must he choose those general courses that will
serve as a foundation for his special study, and that will broaden
and enrich his study, but also he must be provided with a
counter-balance, &mdash; with interests that his special work might
never arouse in him. Thus the field of Scientific Management can be
narrowed to determining and preparing standard plans for standard
specialized men, and selecting men to fill these places from
competent applicants.</p>
<p>What part of the specialized training needed by the special work
shall be given in schools and what in the industries themselves can
be determined later. The "twin apprentice" plan offers one solution
of the problem that has proved satisfactory in many places. The
psychological study should determine <!--Page 032--><a name="P032"
id="P032"></a> through which agency knowledge can best come at
any particular stage of mental growth.</p>
<p><b>Effect on Workers of Such Selection.</b> &mdash; As will be
shown at greater length under "Incentives," Scientific Management
aims in every way to encourage initiative. The outline here given
as to how men must, ultimately, under Scientific Management, be
selected serves to show that, far from being "made machines of,"
men are selected to reach that special place where their
individuality can be recognized and rewarded to the greatest
extent.</p>
<p><b>Selection Under Scientific Management To-day.</b> &mdash; At
the present day, the most that Scientific Management can do, in the
average case, is to determine the type of men needed for any
particular kind of work, and then to select that man who seems,
from such observations as can be made, best to conform to the type.
The accurate knowledge of the requirements of the work, and the
knowledge of variables of the worker make even a cursory
observation more rich in results than it would otherwise be. Even
such an apparently obvious observation, as that the very fact that
a man claims that he can do the work implies desire and will on his
part to do it that may overcome many natural lacks, &mdash; even
this is an advance in recognizing individuality.</p>
<p><b>Effect of This Selection.</b> &mdash; The result of this
scientific selection of the workman is not only better work, but
also, and more important from the psychological side, the
development of his individuality. It is not always recognized that
the work itself is a great <!--Page 033--><a name="P033" id=
"P033"></a> educator, and that acute cleverness in the line of
work to which he is fitted comes to the worker.</p>
<p><b>Individuality Developed by Separating Outputs.</b> &mdash;
Under Scientific Management the work of each man is arranged either
so that his output shows up separately and on the individual
records, or, if the Work is such that it seems best to do it in
gangs, the output can often be so recorded that the individual's
output can be computed from the records.</p>
<p><b>Purpose of Separating Outputs.</b> &mdash; The primary
purpose of separating the output is to see what the man can do, to
record this, and to reward the man according to his work, but this
separating of output has also an individual result, which is even
more important than the result aimed at, and that is the
development of individuality.</p>
<p>Under Traditional Management and the usual "day work," much of
the work is done by gangs and is observed or recorded as of gangs.
Only now and then, when the work of some particular individual
shows up decidedly better or worse than that of his fellows, and
when the foreman or superintendent, or other onlooker, happens to
observe this is the individual appreciated, and then only in the
most inexact, unsystematic manner.</p>
<p>Under Scientific Management, making individual output show up
separately allows of individual recording, tasks, teaching and
rewards.</p>
<p><b>Effect on Athletic Contests.</b> &mdash; Also, with this
separation of the work of the individual under Scientific
Management comes the possibility of a real, <!--Page 034--><a name=
"P034" id="P034"></a> scientific, "athletic contest." This
athletic contest, which proves itself so successful in Traditional
Management, even when the men are grouped as gangs and their work
is not recorded or thought of separately, proves itself quite as
efficient or more efficient under Scientific Management, when the
work of the man shows up separately. It might be objected that the
old gang spirit, or it might be called "team" spirit, would
disappear with the separation of the work. This is not so, as will
be noted by a comparison to a baseball team, where each man has his
separate place and his separate work and where his work shows up
separately with separate records, such as "batting average" and
"fielding average." Team spirit is the result of being grouped
together against a common opponent, and it will be the same in any
sort of work when the men are so grouped, or given to understand
that they belong on the same side.</p>
<p>The following twelve rules for an Athletic Contest under
Transitory System are quoted as exemplifying the benefits which
accrue to Individuality.</p>
<p>&ensp;1. Men must have square deal.</p>
<p>&ensp;2. Conditions must be similar.</p>
<p>&ensp;3. Men must be properly spaced and placed.</p>
<p>&ensp;4. Output must show up separately.</p>
<p>&ensp;5. Men must be properly started.</p>
<p>&ensp;6. Causes for delay must be eliminated.</p>
<p>&ensp;7. Pace maker must be provided.</p>
<p>&ensp;8. Time for rest must be provided.</p>
<p>&ensp;9. Individual scores must be kept and posted.</p>
<p>10. "Audience" must be provided. <!--Page 035--><a name="P035"
id="P035"></a></p>
<p>11. Rewards must be prompt and provided for all good scores
&mdash; not for winners only.</p>
<p>12. Appreciation must be shown. <a href=
"#ch02fn11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>This list shows the effects of many fundamental principles of
Scientific Management, &mdash; but we note particularly here that
over half the rules demand that outputs be separated as a
prerequisite.</p>
<p>None of the benefits of the Athletic Contest are lost under
Scientific Management. The only restrictions placed are that the
men shall not be grouped according to any distinction that would
cause hatred or ill feeling, that the results shall be ultimately
beneficial to the workers themselves, and that all high scores
shall win high prizes.</p>
<p>As will be brought out later under "Incentives," no competition
is approved under Scientific Management which speeds up the men
uselessly, or which brings any ill feeling between the men or any
feeling that the weaker ones have not a fair chance. All of these
things are contrary to Scientific Management, as well as contrary
to common sense, for it goes without saying that no man is capable
of doing his best work permanently if he is worried by the idea
that he will not receive the square deal, that someone stronger
than he will be allowed to cheat or to domineer over him, or that
he will be speeded up to such an extent that while his work will
increase for one day, the next day his work will fall down because
of the effect of the fatigue of the day before.</p>
<p>The field of the contests is widened, as separating
<!--Page 036--><a name="P036" id="P036"></a> of the work of the
individual not only allows for competition between individuals, but
for the competition of the individual with his own records. This
competition is not only a great, constant and helpful incentive to
every worker, but it is also an excellent means of developing
individuality.</p>
<p><b>Advantages to Managers of Separating Output.</b> &mdash; The
advantages to the managers of separating the work are that there is
a chance to know exactly who is making the high output, and that
the spirit of competition which prevails when men compare their
outputs to their own former records or others, leads to increased
effort.</p>
<p><b>Advantages to Workers of Separating Output.</b> &mdash; As
for advantages to the men:</p>
<p>By separation of the individual work, not only is the man's work
itself shown, but at the same time the work of all other people is
separated, cut away and put aside, and he can locate the man who is
delaying him by, for example, not keeping him supplied with
materials. The man has not only an opportunity to concentrate, but
every possible incentive to exercise his will and his desire to do
things. His attention is concentrated on the fact that he as an
individual is expected to do his very best. He has the moral
stimulus of responsibility. He has the emotional stimulus of
competition. He has the mental stimulus of definiteness. He has,
most valuable of all, a chance to be an entity rather than one of
an undiscriminated gang. This chance to be an individual, or
personality, is in great contradistinction to the popular opinion
of Scientific Management, <!--Page 037--><a name="P037" id=
"P037"></a> which thinks it turns men into machines. A very
simple example of the effect of the worker's seeing his output show
up separately in response to and in proportion to his effort and
skill is that of boys in the lumber producing districts chopping
edgings for fire wood. Here the chopping is so comparatively light
that the output increased very rapidly, and the boy delights to
"see his pile of fire wood grow."</p>
<p>With the separation of the work comes not only the opportunity
for the men to see their own work, but also to see that of others,
and there comes with this the spirit of imitation, or the spirit of
friendly opposition, either of which, while valuable in itself is
even more valuable as the by-product of being a life-giving
thought, and of putting life into the work such as there never
could be when the men were working together, more or less
objectless, because they could not see plainly either what they
were doing themselves, or what others were doing.</p>
<p>Separation of the output of the men gives them the greatest
opportunity to develop. It gives them a chance to concentrate their
attention at the work on which they are, because it is not
necessary for them to waste any time to find out what that work is.
Their work stands out by itself; they can put their whole minds to
that work; they can become interested in that work and its outcome,
and they can be positive that what they have done will be
appreciated and recognized, and that it will have a good effect,
with no possibility of evil effect, upon their chance for work and
their chance for pay and promotion in the future. Definiteness of
the boundaries, then, is <!--Page 038--><a name="P038" id=
"P038"></a> not only good management in that it shows up the
work and that it allows each man to see, and each man over him, or
observing him to see exactly what has been done, &mdash; it has
also an excellent effect upon the worker's mind.</p>
<p><b>Individuality Developed by Recording Output Separately.</b>
&mdash; The spirit of individuality is brought out still more
clearly by the fact that under Scientific Management, output is
recorded separately. This recording of the outputs separately is,
usually, and very successfully, one of the first features installed
in Transitory Management, and a feature very seldom introduced,
even unconscious of its worth, in day work under Traditional
Management. It is one of the great disadvantages of many kinds of
work, especially in this day, that the worker does only a small
part of the finished article and that he has a feeling that what he
does is not identified permanently with the success of the
completed whole. We may note that one of the great unsatisfying
features to such arts as acting and music, is that no matter how
wonderful the performer's efforts, there was no permanent record of
them; that the work of the day dies with the day. He can expect to
live only in the minds and hearts of the hearers, in the accounts
of spectators, or in histories of the stage.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, not strange that the world's best actors and
singers are now grasping the opportunity to make their best efforts
permanent through the instrumentality of the motion picture films
and the talking machine records. This same feeling, minus the glow
of enthusiasm that at least attends the actor
<!--Page 039--><a name="P039" id="P039"></a> during the work, is
present in more or less degree in the mind of the worker.</p>
<p><b>Records Make Work Seem Worth While.</b> &mdash; With the
feeling that his work is recorded comes the feeling that the work
is really worth while, for even if the work itself does not last,
the records of it are such as can go on.</p>
<p><b>Records Give Individuals a Feeling of Permanence.</b> &mdash;
With recorded individual output comes also the feeling of
permanence, of credit for good performance. This desire for
permanence shows itself all through the work of men in Traditional
Management, for example &mdash; in the stone cutter's art where the
man who had successfully dressed the stone from the rough block was
delighted to put his own individual mark on it, even though he knew
that that mark probably would seldom, if ever, be noticed again by
anyone after the stone was set in the wall. It is an underlying
trait of the human mind to desire this permanence of record of
successful effort, and fulfilling and utilizing this desire is a
great gain of Scientific Management.</p>
<p><b>Mental Development of Worker Through Records.</b> &mdash; It
is not only for his satisfaction that the worker should see his
records and realize that his work has permanence, but also for
comparison of his work not only with his own record, but with the
work of others. The value of these comparisons, not only to the
management but to the worker himself, must not be underestimated.
The worker gains mental development and physical skill by studying
these comparisons.</p>
<!--Page 040--><a name="P040" id="P040"></a>
<p><b>Advantages to Worker of Making his Own Records.</b> &mdash;
These possibilities of mental development are still further
increased when the man makes his own records. This leads to closer
attention, to more interest in the work, and to a realization of
the man as to what the record really means, and what value it
represents. Though even a record that is made for him and is posted
where he can see it will probably result in a difference in his pay
envelope, no such progress is likely to occur as when the man makes
his own record, and must be conscious every moment of the time
exactly where he stands.</p>
<p><b>Possibilities of Making Individual Records.</b> &mdash;
Records of individual efficiency are comparatively easy to make
when output is separated. But even when work must be done by gangs
or teams of men, there is provision made in Scientific Management
for recording this gang work in such a way that either the output
or the efficiency, or both, of each man shows up separately. This
may be done in several ways, such as, for example, by recording the
total time of delays avoidable and unavoidable, caused by each man,
and from this computing individual records. This method of
recording is psychologically right, because the recording of the
delay will serve as a warning to the man, and as a spur to him not
to cause delay to others again.</p>
<p>The forcefulness of the "don't" and the "never" have been
investigated by education. Undoubtedly the "do" is far stronger,
but in this particular case the command deduced from the records of
delay to others is, necessarily, in the negative form, and a
<!--Page 041--><a name="P041" id="P041"></a> study of the
psychological results proves most instructive.</p>
<p><b>Benefits to Managers of Individual Records.</b> &mdash; The
value of the training to the foremen, to the superintendents and to
the managers higher up, who study these records, as well as to the
timekeepers, recorders and clerks in the Time and Cost Department
who make the records, is obvious. There is not only the possibility
of appreciating and rewarding the worker, and thus stimulating him
to further activity, there is also, especially in the Transitory
stage, when men are to be chosen on whom to make Time Study
observations, an excellent chance to compare various methods of
doing work and their results.</p>
<p><b>Incentives with Individual Records.</b> &mdash; The greatest
value of recorded outputs is in the appreciation of the work of the
individual that becomes possible. First of all, appreciation by the
management, which to the worker must be the most important of all,
as it means to him a greater chance for promotion and for more pay.
This promotion and additional pay are amply provided for by
Scientific Management, as will be shown later in discussing
Incentives and Welfare.</p>
<p>Not only is the work appreciated by the management and by the
man himself, but also the work becomes possible of appreciation by
others. The form of the record as used in Scientific Management,
and as introduced early in the transitory stage, makes it possible
for many beside those working on the job, if they take the pains to
consult the records, which are best posted in a conspicuous place
on the work, <!--Page 042--><a name="P042" id="P042"></a> to
know and appreciate what the worker is doing. This can be best
illustrated, perhaps, by various methods of recording output on
contracting work, &mdash; out-of-door work.</p>
<p>The flag flown by the successful contestants in the athletic
contests, showing which gang or which individual has made the
largest output during the day previous, allows everyone who passes
to appreciate the attainment of that particular worker, or that
group of workers. The photographs of the "high priced men," copies
of which may be given to the workers themselves, allow the worker
to carry home a record and thus impress his family with what he has
done. Too often the family is unable by themselves to understand
the value of the worker's work, or to appreciate the effect of his
home life, food, and rest conditions upon his life work, and this
entire strong element of interest of the worker's family in his
work is often lost.</p>
<p><b>Relation of Individual Records to Scientific Management in
General</b>. &mdash; Any study of Records of an individual's work
again makes clear that no one topic of Scientific Management can be
properly noted without a consideration of all other elements. The
fact that under Scientific Management the record with which the man
most surely and constantly competes is his own, as provided for by
the individual instruction card and the individual task; the fact
that under Scientific Management the man need be in no fear of
losing his job if he does his best; the fact that Scientific
Management is founded on the "square deal"; &mdash; all of these
facts must be kept constantly in mind <!--Page 043--><a name="P043"
id="P043"></a> when considering the advantages of recording
individual output, for they all have a strong psychological effect
on the man's mind. It is important to remember that not only does
Scientific Management provide for certain directions and thoughts
entering the man's mind, but that it also eliminates other thoughts
which would surely have a tendency to retard his work. The result
is output far exceeding what is usually possible under Traditional
Management, because drawbacks are removed and impetuses added.</p>
<p>The outcome of the records, and their related elements in other
branches of Scientific Management, is to arouse interest. Interest
arouses abnormally concentrated attention, and this in turn is the
cause of genius. This again answers the argument of those who claim
that Scientific Management kills individuality and turns the worker
into a machine.</p>
<p><b>Individual Task Under Scientific Management.</b> &mdash;
Individuality is also taken into consideration when preparing the
task. This task would always be for an individual, even in the case
of the gang instruction card. It usually recognizes individuality,
in that, &mdash;</p>
<p>1. It is prepared for one individual only, when possible.</p>
<p>2. It is prepared for the particular individual who is to do
it.</p>
<p>The working time, as will be shown later, is based upon time
study observations on a standard man, but when a task is assigned
for a certain individual, that proportion of the work of the
standard or first class <!--Page 044--><a name="P044" id=
"P044"></a> man is assigned to that particular given man who is
actually to do it, which he is able to do. It is fundamental that
the task must be such that the man who is actually put at it, when
he obeys orders and works steadily, can do it; that is, the task
must be achievable, and achievable without such effort as would do
mental or physical injury to the worker. This not only gives the
individual the proper amount of work to do, recognizes his
particular capabilities and is particularly adapted to him, but it
also eliminates all dread on the score of his not being
appreciated, in that the worker knows that if he achieves or
exceeds his task he will not only receive the wage for it, but will
continue to receive that wage, or more, for like achievement. The
rate is not cut. Under the "three-rate with increased rate system,"
which experience has shown to be a most advanced plan for
compensating workmen, the worker receives one bonus for exactness
as to methods, that is, he receives one bonus if he does the task
exactly as he is instructed to do it as to methods; and a second
bonus, or extra bonus, if he completes his task in the allotted
time. This not only assures adequate pay to the man who is slow,
but a good imitator, but also to the man who, perhaps, is not such
a good imitator, and must put attention on the quality rather than
the quantity of his performance.</p>
<p><b>Individuality Emphasized by Instruction Card.</b> &mdash;
This individual task is embodied in an individual instruction
card.</p>
<p>In all work where it is possible to do so, the worker is given
an individual instruction card, even though <!--Page 045--><a name=
"P045" id="P045"></a> his operations and rest periods are also
determined by a gang instruction card. This card not only tells the
man what he is to do, how he can best do it, and the time that it
is supposed to take him to do it, &mdash; but it bears also the
signature of the man who made it. This in order that if the worker
cannot fulfill the requirements of the card he may lose no time in
determining who is to give him the necessary instructions or help
that will result in his earning his large wages. More than this, he
must call for help from his assigned teachers, as is stated in
large type on a typical Instruction Card as follows: "When
instructions cannot be carried out, foreman must at once report to
man who signed this card."</p>
<p>The signature of the man who made the card not only develops his
sense of individuality and responsibility, but helps create a
feeling of inter-responsibility between the workers in various
parts of the organization.</p>
<p><b>The Gang Instruction Card</b>. &mdash; A gang instruction
card is used for such work only as must be done by a group of men
all engaged at the work at once, or who are working at a dependent
sequence of operations, or both. This card contains but those
portions of the instructions for each man which refer to those
elements which must be completed before a following element, to be
done by the next man in the sequence, can be completed. Because of
the nature of the work, the gang instruction card must be put in
the hands of a leader, or foreman, whether or not it is also in the
hands of each of the individuals. The amount of work which can be
required as a set task for each individual <!--Page 046--><a name=
"P046" id="P046"></a> member of the gang, the allowance for rest
for overcoming fatigue, the time that the rest periods must occur,
and the proper pay, are fully stated on the Individual Instruction
Cards.</p>
<p><b>Methods of Teaching Foster Individuality.</b> &mdash; As will
be shown at length in the Chapter on Teaching, under Scientific
Management teaching is not only general, by "Systems," "Standing
Orders," or "Standard Practice," but also specific. Specialized
teachers, called, unfortunately for the emphasis desired to be put
on teaching, "functional foremen," help the individual worker to
overcome his peculiar difficulties.</p>
<p>This teaching not only allows every worker to supplement his
deficiencies of disposition or experience, but the teachers' places
give opportunities for those who have a talent for imparting
knowledge to utilize and develop it.</p>
<p><b>Individual Incentive and Welfare.</b> &mdash; Finally,
individual incentive and individual welfare are not only both
present, but interdependent. Desire for individual success, which
might lead a worker to respond to the incentive till he held back
perhaps the work of others, is held in balance by interdependence
of bonuses. This will be explained in full in the Chapters on
Incentives and Welfare.</p>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p><b>Result of Idea of Individuality upon Work.</b> &mdash; To
recapitulate; &mdash; Under Traditional Management, because of its
frequent neglect of the idea of individuality, work is often
unsystematized, and high <!--Page 047--><a name="P047" id=
"P047"></a> output is usually the result of "speeding up" only,
with constant danger of a falling off in quality overbalancing men
and injury to men and machinery.</p>
<p>Under Transitory Management, as outputs are separated,
separately recorded, and as the idea of Individuality is embodied
in selecting men, setting tasks, the instruction cards, periods of
rest, teaching, incentives and welfare, output increases without
undue pressure on the worker.</p>
<p>Under Scientific Management &mdash; with various elements which
embody individuality fully developed, output increases, to the
welfare of worker, manager, employer and consumer and with no
falling off in quality.</p>
<p><b>Effect Upon the Worker.</b> &mdash; The question of the
effect upon the worker of emphasis laid upon individuality, can
perhaps best be answered by asking and answering the following
questions: &mdash;</p>
<p>1. When, where, how, and how much is individuality
considered?</p>
<p>2. What consideration is given to the relation of the mind to
the body of the individual?</p>
<p>3. What is the relative emphasis on consideration of individual
and class?</p>
<p>4. In how far is the individual the unit?</p>
<p>5. What consideration is given to idiosyncrasies?</p>
<p>6. What is the effect toward causing or bringing about
development, that is, broadening, deepening and making the
individual more progressive?</p>
<p><b>Extent of Consideration of Individuality</b>. &mdash; 1.
Under Traditional Management consideration of individuality is
seldom present, but those best forms of Traditional
<!--Page 048--><a name="P048" id="P048"></a> Management that are
successful are so because it is present. This is not usually
recognized, but investigation shows that the successful manager, or
foreman, or boss, or superintendent succeeds either because of his
own individuality or because he brings out to good advantage the
individual possibilities of his men. The most successful workers
under Traditional Management are those who are allowed to be
individuals and to follow out their individual bents of greatest
efficiency, instead of being crowded down to become mere members of
gangs, with no chance to think, to do, or to be anything but parts
of the gang.</p>
<p>Under Transitory Management, and most fully under Scientific
Management, the spirit of individuality, far from being crowded
out, is a basic principle, and everything possible is done to
encourage the desire to be a personality.</p>
<p><b>Relation of Mind to Body.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional
Management, where men worked in the same employ for a long time,
much consideration was given to the relation of the mind to the
body. It was realized that men must not be speeded up beyond what
they could do healthfully; they must have good sleeping quarters
and good, savory and appetizing food to eat and not be fatigued
unnecessarily, if they were to become successful workers. More than
this, philanthropic employers often attempted to supply many kinds
of comfort and amusement.</p>
<p>Under Transitory Management the physical and mental welfare are
provided for more systematically.</p>
<p>Under Scientific Management consideration of the
<!--Page 049--><a name="P049" id="P049"></a> mind and body of
the workman, and his health, and all that that includes, is a
subject for scientific study and for scientific administration. As
shown later, it eliminates all discussion and troubles of so-called
"welfare work," because the interests of the employer and the
worker become identical and everything that is done becomes the
concern of both.</p>
<p>Scientific Management realizes that the condition of the body
effects every possible mental process. It is one of the great
advantages of a study of the psychology of management that the
subject absolutely demands from the start, and insists in every
stage of the work, on this relationship of the body to the mind,
and of the surroundings, equipment, etc., of the worker to his
work.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible, in management, to separate the subject
of the worker from that of his work, or to think of the worker as
not working except in such a sense as "ceasing-from-work,"
"about-to-work," "resting to overcome fatigue of work," or "resting
during periods of unavoidable delays." The relation of the worker
to his work is constantly in the mind of the manager. It is for
this reason that not only does management owe much to psychology,
but that psychology, as applied to any line of study, will,
ultimately, be recognized as owing much to the science of
management.</p>
<p><b>Relative Emphasis on Individual and Class.</b> &mdash; Under
Traditional Management the gang, or the class, usually receives the
chief emphasis. If the individual developed, as he undoubtedly did,
in many kinds of mechanical work, especially in small
organizations, <!--Page 050--><a name="P050" id="P050"></a> it
was more or less because it was not possible for the managers to
organize the various individuals into classes or gangs. In the
transitory stage the emphasis is shifting. Under Scientific
Management the emphasis is most decidedly and emphatically upon the
individual as the unit to be managed, as has been shown.</p>
<p><b>Individual as the Unit.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional
Management the individual was seldom the unit. Under Transitory
Management the individual is the unit, but there is not much
emphasis in the early stages placed upon his peculiarities and
personalities. Under Scientific Management the unit is always the
individual, and the utilizing and strengthening of his personal
traits, special ability and skill is a dominating feature.</p>
<p><b>Emphasis on Idiosyncrasies.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional
Management there is either no consideration given to
idiosyncrasies, or too wide a latitude is allowed. In cases where
no consideration is given, there is often either a pride in the
managers in "treating all men alike," though they might respond
better to different handling, or else the individual is undirected
and his personality manifests itself in all sorts of unguided
directions, many of which must necessarily be wasteful,
unproductive, or incomplete in development. Under Scientific
Management, functionalization, as will be shown, provides for the
utilization of all idiosyncrasies and efficient deviations from
class, and promotion is so planned that a man may develop along the
line of his chief ability. Thus initiative is encouraged and
developed constantly.</p>
<p><b>Development of Individuality.</b> &mdash; The development
<!--Page 051--><a name="P051" id="P051"></a> of individuality is
more sure under Scientific Management than it is under either of
the other two forms of management, (a) because this development is
recognized to be a benefit to the worker and to the employer and
(b) because this development as a part of a definite plan is
provided for and perfected scientifically.</p>

<h3>FUNCTIONALIZATION</h3>
<p><b>Definition of Functionalization.</b> &mdash; A function, says
the Century Dictionary, is &mdash; "The fulfilment or discharge of
a set duty or requirement, exercise of a faculty or office, or
power of acting, faculty, &mdash; that power of acting in a
specific way which appertains to a thing by virtue of its special
constitution; that mode of action or operation which is proper to
any organ, faculty, office structure, etc. (This is the most usual
signification of the term)."</p>
<p>"Functionalization" is not given in the Century Dictionary. The
nearest to it to be found there is "Functionality," which is
defined as &mdash; "The state of having or being a function."
Functionalization as here used means &mdash; the state of being
divided into functions, or being functionalized. "Functionalize" is
given in the Century Dictionary, defined as "to assign some office
or function to" &mdash; the note being made that it is rare.
"Functionalize" may not be the best word that could be used in this
connection, but there seems to be no other word in the English
language which contains its full meaning, therefore we will use the
word here in the sense of assigning work according to capacity or
faculty. A faculty means &mdash; "A specific power, mental or
physical; a <!--Page 053--><a name="P053" id="P053"></a> special
capacity for any particular kind of action or affection; natural
capability."</p>
<p><b>Psychological Use of Functionalization.</b> &mdash; The word
"Function" is in constant use by modern psychologists, especially
by those who believe that &mdash; "Psychology is the science of the
self in relation to environment," <a href=
"#ch03fn01"><sup>1</sup></a> or that "Psychology is a scientific
account of our mental processes."<a href=
"#ch03fn02"><sup>2</sup></a> Sully defines a function as "a
psychologically simple process," <a href=
"#ch03fn03"><sup>3</sup></a> and compares its elementariness to a
muscular contraction as an element of a step in walking.</p>
<p>In investigating the principle of Functionalization as embodied
in various forms of Management, we must note that, while Management
can, and does under Scientific Management, attempt to functionalize
<i>work</i> as far as possible, it will be impossible to come to
ultimate results until a psychological study of the requirement of
the work <i>from</i> the worker, and results of the work <i>on</i>
the worker is made.<a href="#ch03fn04"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Functionalization in Management.</b> &mdash; "Functional
Management" consists, to quote Dr. Taylor, "in so directing the
work of management that each man from the assistant superintendent
down shall have as few functions as possible to perform. If
practicable, the work of each man in the management should be
confined to the performance of a single leading function." <a href=
"#ch03fn05"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<!--Page 054--><a name="P054" id="P054"></a>
<p>A study of functionalization as applied to management must
answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. How is the work divided?</p>
<p>2. How are the workers assigned to the work?</p>
<p>3. What are the results to the work?</p>
<p>4. What are the results to the worker?</p>
<p><b>Traditional Management Seldom Functionalizes.</b> &mdash;
Under Traditional Management the principle of Functionalization was
seldom applied or understood. Even when the manager tried to
separate planning from performing, or so to divide the work that
each worker could utilize his special ability, there were no
permanently beneficial results, because there was no standard
method of division.</p>
<p><b>The Work of the Foreman Not Properly Divided.</b> &mdash; The
work of a foreman was not divided, but the well rounded man, as Dr.
Taylor says,<a href="#ch03fn06"><sup>6</sup></a> was supposed to
have</p>
<p>1. Brain</p>
<p>2. Education</p>
<p>3. Special or technical knowledge, manual dexterity or
strength</p>
<p>4. Tact</p>
<p>5. Energy</p>
<p>6. Grit</p>
<p>7. Honesty</p>
<p>8. Judgment, or common sense</p>
<p>9. Good health.</p>
<p>Dr. Taylor says &mdash; "Plenty of men who possess only three of
the above qualities can be hired at any time for laborer's wages.
Add four of these qualities together, <!--Page 055--><a name="P055"
id="P055"></a> and you get a higher priced man. The man
combining five of these qualities begins to be hard to find, and
those with 6, 7 and 8 are almost impossible to get."</p>
<p>Yet, under Traditional Management these general qualities and
many points of specific training were demanded of the foreman. Dr.
Taylor has enumerated the qualifications or the duties of a gang
boss in charge of lathes or planers. <a href=
"#ch03fn07"><sup>7</sup></a> Careful reading of this enumeration
will show most plainly that the demands made were almost impossible
of fulfillment. <a href="#ch03fn08"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Another list which is interesting is found in "Cost Reducing
System," a long list of the duties of the Ideal Superintendent or
foreman in construction work. <a href=
"#ch03fn09"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p class="ltritem">teaching the improvers.</p>
<p class="ltritem">teaching the learners.</p>
<p>In studying these lists we note &mdash;</p>
<p>1. That the position will be best filled by a very high and rare
type of man.</p>
<p>2. That the man is forced to use every atom of all of his powers
and at the same time to waste his energies in doing much
unimportant pay reducing routine work, some of which could be done
by clerks.</p>
<p>3. That in many cases the work assigned for him to do calls for
qualifications which are diametrically opposed to each other.</p>
<p>4. That psychology tells us that a man fitted to perform some of
these duties would probably be mentally ill fitted for performing
others in the best possible way that they could be performed.</p>
<p><b>Work Not Well Done.</b> &mdash; Not only does the foreman
under Traditional Management do a great deal of work which can be
done by cheaper men, but he also wastes his time on clerical work
in which he is not a specialist, and, therefore, which he does not
do as well as the work can be done by a cheaper man, and this takes
more of his time than he ought to devote to it. The result is that
the work is not done as well as it can and should be done.</p>
<p>A most perfect illustration of a common form of Traditional
Management is the old story of the foreman, who, in making his
rounds of the various parts of the work, comes to the deep hole
being excavated for a foundation pier and says hurriedly &mdash;
"How many of yez is there in the hole?" "Seven." "The half of yez
come up."</p>
<!--Page 059--><a name="P059" id="P059"></a>
<p>The theoretical defects of the old type of management often seen
before the advent of the trained engineer on the work include:
&mdash;</p>
<p>&ensp;1. lack of planning ahead.</p>
<p>&ensp;2. an overworked foreman.</p>
<p>&ensp;3. no functionalizing of the work.</p>
<p>&ensp;4. no standards of individual efficiency.</p>
<p>&ensp;5. unmeasured individual outputs.</p>
<p>&ensp;6. no standard methods.</p>
<p>&ensp;7. no attempt at teaching.</p>
<p>&ensp;8. inaccurate directions.</p>
<p>&ensp;9. lack of athletic contests.</p>
<p>10. no high pay for extra efficiency.</p>
<p>11. poor investigation of workers' special capabilities.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that under unfunctionalized management the
foreman has far more to do than he can expect to do well, the
average foreman thinks that he belongs to a class above his
position. This is partly because the position is so unstandardized
that it arouses a sense of unrest, and partly because he has to
spend much of his time at low priced functions.</p>
<p>Under the feeling of enmity, or at least, of opposition, which
often exists, openly or secretly, between the average Traditional
Management and men, the foreman must ally himself with one side or
the other. If he joins with the men, he must countenance the
soldiering, which they find necessary in order to maintain their
rates of wages. Thus the output of the shop will seldom increase
and his chance for appreciation and promotion by the management
will probably <!--Page 060--><a name="P060" id="P060"></a> be
slight and slow. His position as boss, combined with that of ally
of the men, is awkward.</p>
<p>If he allies himself to the management, he must usually become a
driver of the men, if he wishes to increase output. This condition
will never be agreeable to him unless he has an oversupply of brute
instincts.</p>
<p><b>The Workers Not Best Utilized.</b> &mdash; Under the best
types of Traditional Management we do find more or less spasmodic
attempts at the functionalization of the worker. When there was any
particular kind of work to be done, the worker who seemed to the
manager to be the best fitted, was set at that kind of work. For
example &mdash; if there was a particularly heavy piece of work he
might say &mdash; "Let A do it because he is strong." If there was
a particularly fine piece of work to be done he might say &mdash;
"Let B do it because he is specially skilled." If there was a piece
of work to be done which required originality, he might say &mdash;
"Let C do it for the reason that he is inventive and resourceful;"
but, in most cases, when the particular job on hand was finished,
the worker selected to do it returned to other classes of work, and
such special fitness or capability as he had, was seldom
systematically utilized, or automatically assigned to his special
function, neither was such experience as he had gained
systematically conserved. Moreover, no such study of the work to be
done had been made as would prove that the assignment of that
particular worker to the work was right. The psychology of this was
entirely wrong, &mdash; not only had no such study of the general
and particular characteristics, traits, faculties, and
<!--Page 061--><a name="P061" id="P061"></a> talents of the man
been made as would prove that he was the right man to be assigned,
but the mere fact that he possessed one quality necessary for the
work, if he really did possess it, was no sign that the other
qualities which he possessed might not make him the wrong man to be
chosen. Even if the man did happen to be assigned to work for which
he was particularly suited, unless provision were made to keep him
at such work only, to keep him well supplied with work, to allow
time for rest, and to provide proper pay, he could not utilize his
capabilities to the fullest extent.</p>
<p><b>Transitory Management Functionalizes.</b> &mdash; Under
Transitory Management, management becomes gradually more and more
functionalized. With separated outputs and separate records, the
worker's capabilities become apparent, and he can be assigned to
the standardized positions which gradually evolve. Every
recognition of individuality carries with it a corresponding
functionalization of men and work.</p>
<p><b>Functionalization a Fundamental of Scientific Management.</b>
&mdash; With Scientific Management comes the realization that with
close study and with functionalization only, can that provision and
assignment of the work which is best for both work and worker be
obtained. The principle is applied to every part of management, and
results in</p>
<p>1. separating the planning from the performing.</p>
<p>2. functionalizing foremen.</p>
<p>3. functionalizing workers.</p>
<p>4. assigning competent workers to fitting work.</p>
<p><b>Separating the Planning from the Performing.</b> &mdash; The
emphasis on separating the planning from <!--Page 062--><a name=
"P062" id="P062"></a> the performing in Scientific Management
cannot be over-estimated. It is a part of Dr. Taylor's fourth
principle of Scientific Management, "Almost equal division of the
work and the responsibility between the management and the
workmen."<a href="#ch03fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> The greatest outputs
can be achieved to the greatest benefit to managers and men when
the work is divided, the management undertaking that part of the
work that it is best fitted to do, the workmen performing that part
which they are best fitted to do.</p>
<p><b>The Work of the Planning Department.</b> &mdash; It has been
determined by actual experience that the line of division most
agreeable to the managers and the workmen and most productive of
co&ouml;peration by both, as well as most efficient in producing
low costs, is that which separates the planning from the
performing. Under Scientific Management the Planning Department
relieves the man of determining &mdash;</p>
<p>1. what work is to be done.</p>
<p>2. sequence in which it is to be done.</p>
<p>3. method by which it shall be done.</p>
<p>4. where it shall be done.</p>
<p>5. which men shall do it.</p>
<p>6. time that it shall take.</p>
<p>7. exact quality of product.</p>
<p>8. quantity of additional pay that shall be given for doing
it.</p>
<p><b>Work of the Workers.</b> &mdash; The men are simply given
standard tasks to do, with teachers to help them, and a standard
wage according to performance as a reward. <!--Page 063--><a name=
"P063" id="P063"></a> There are but three things expected of
them: &mdash;</p>
<p>1. co&ouml;peration with the management in obtaining the
prescribed work, method and quality.</p>
<p>2. the exercise of their ingenuity in making improvements after
they have learned the standard prescribed practice.</p>
<p>3. the fitting of themselves for higher pay and promotion.</p>
<p><b>Functionalized Foremanship.</b> &mdash; The work that, under
Scientific Management, is usually done by one man, the Foreman, is
subdivided into eight or more functions. These functions are
assigned to the following functional foremen: <a href=
"#ch03fn11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Planning Department</p>
<p class="ltritem">1. Order of work and route man</p>
<p class="ltritem">2. Instruction card man</p>
<p class="ltritem">3. Cost and time clerk</p>
<p class="ltritem">4. Disciplinarian</p>
<p>Performing Department</p>
<p class="ltritem">5. Gang boss</p>
<p class="ltritem">6. Speed boss</p>
<p class="ltritem">7. Repair boss</p>
<p class="ltritem">8. Inspector</p>
<p>Each of the above functions may be in charge of a separate man,
or one man may be in charge of several functions, or several men
may do the work of one function; the work being divided between
them in some cases by further functionalizing it, &mdash; and in
others by separating it into similar parts. Which of
<!--Page 064--><a name="P064" id="P064"></a> these conditions is
most effective depends on the size of the job, or the nature of the
job to be done. The important question is, not the number of men
doing the planning, but the fact that every foreman, so far as is
possible, is assigned to the special kind of work that he is best
fitted to do with the greatest elimination of unnecessary
waste.</p>
<p><b>Changes in the Functions of the Foreman.</b> &mdash; A
Foreman, under Scientific Management, must have three
qualifications. He must be</p>
<p>1. a specialist at the work that he is to do.</p>
<p>2. a good observer, able to note minute variations of method,
work, and efficiency.</p>
<p>3. a good teacher.</p>
<p>A comparison of these qualifications with those of the foreman
under Traditional Management, will show as important changes,
&mdash;</p>
<p>1. the particular place in the field of knowledge in which the
foreman must specialize.</p>
<p>2. the change in the type of criticism expected from the
foreman.</p>
<p>3. the far greater emphasis placed on duties as a teacher.</p>
<p><b>Importance of the Teaching Feature in Functional
Foremanship.</b> &mdash; The teaching feature of management,
&mdash; the most important feature of Scientific Management,
&mdash; will be discussed in the Chapter on Teaching. Only so much
is included here as shows its derivation from the principle of
functionalization, and its underlying importance.</p>
<p>Functionalization means specialization. This results in
co&ouml;peration between foremen, between foremen
<!--Page 065--><a name="P065" id="P065"></a> and workers, and
between workers. By "co-operate" is here meant not only "to work
together," but also "to work together to promote the object." This
co&ouml;peration persists not only because it is demanded by the
work, but also because it is insured by the inter-dependent
bonuses.</p>
<p>Functionalization under Scientific Management separates planning
from performing. This means that the specialists who plan must
teach the specialist who performs, this being the way in which they
co-operate to the greatest personal advantage to all.</p>
<p><b>Basis of Division into Functions.</b> &mdash; Under
Scientific Management divisions are made on the basis of underlying
ideas. Functions are not classified as they are embodied in
particular men, but men are classified as they embody particular
functions. This allows of standardization, through which alone can
progress and evolution come quickest. It is comparatively easy and
simple to standardize a function. Being a "set duty," it can be
fixed, studied and simplified. It is extremely difficult and
complex to standardize an individual. This standardizing of the
function, however, in no wise stunts individuality. On the
contrary, it gives each individual a chance to utilize his
particular faculty for obtaining the greatest efficiency, pleasure
and profit. This is well illustrated in the case of specialization
in baseball, for excellence as a pitcher does not stunt the player
as a catcher.</p>
<p>Functions may be subdivided as far as the nature of the work
demands. Note here, again, that it is the relative complexity or
simplicity of the nature of the work that is to be done that
determines the degree <!--Page 066--><a name="P066" id=
"P066"></a> of its functionalization, not the number of men
employed at the work.</p>
<p>Note, also, that with every subdivision of functions comes
greater opportunity for specialization, hence for individual
development.</p>
<p><b>Place of Operation of the Functions.</b> &mdash; Four
functions of the eight find their place in the planning department.
The other four are out on the work. That is to say, &mdash; the men
who represent four functions work almost entirely in the planning
room, while the men who represent the other four functions work
mostly among the workers. This division is, however, largely a
matter of convenience. Three of the first four groups of men
communicate with the workers mostly in writing and are seldom
engaged as observers, except in obtaining data for the creation of
standards, while the fourth is often in the planning room. The last
four usually communicate with the men orally, and must observe and
teach the worker constantly.</p>
<p>In the descriptions that follow, each function is represented as
embodied in one man, this aiding simplicity and clearness in
description.</p>
<p><b>The Order of Work and Route Clerk.</b> &mdash; The Order of
Work and Route Clerk lays out the exact path of each piece of work,
and determines the sequence of events of moving and a general
outline of performance. <a href="#ch03fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> With
the requirements of the work in mind, the most efficient day's work
for each worker is determined. The paths and sequences of
transportation <!--Page 067--><a name="P067" id="P067"></a> are
outlined by means of route charts and route sheets showing
graphical and detailed directions, which are the means by which the
foremen of the other functions are enabled to co&ouml;perate with
other foremen and with the workers.</p>
<p>The work of this function requires a practical man, of the
successful foreman type, experienced in the class of work to be
executed, who is also familiar with the theories of Scientific
Management in general, and the work of the other foremen in
particular, and who has the faculty of visualization and well
developed constructive imagination. He must also have at his
command in systematic form, and available for immediate use,
records of previous experience.</p>
<p><b>The Instruction Card Clerk</b>. &mdash; The Instruction Card
Clerk prepares written directions for the workers as to what
methods should be used in doing the work, the sequence of
performance of the elements of the method, the speeds and action of
the accompanying machinery, the time that each element should take
for its performance, the time allowed for rest for overcoming
fatigue caused by its performance, and the total elapsed time
allowed for performing all of the work on the instruction card in
order to obtain the unusually high additional wages as a reward for
his skill and co&ouml;peration.</p>
<p>The work of this function requires the best available (but not
necessarily the fastest), practical experienced man in the trade
described, who also has had sufficient experience in motion study
and time study to enable him to write down the best known method
for doing the work described, and also <!--Page 068--><a name=
"P068" id="P068"></a> prophesying the correct time that the work
and rest from its resulting fatigue will take. He must supplement
the instruction card with such sketches, drawings and photographs
as will best assist the worker to visualize his work before and
during its performance.</p>
<p><b>Function of Time and Cost Clerk</b>. &mdash; The work done by
the Time and Cost Clerk calls for accuracy and a love of
statistical detail. It will help him if he knows the trades with
which he is co&ouml;perating, but such knowledge is not absolutely
essential. He will be promoted fastest who has a knowledge of the
theory of management, coupled with the theory and practice of
statistics and accountancy, for the true costs must include
knowledge of costs of materials, and the distribution of the
overhead burden of running expenses and selling.</p>
<p><b>Function of the Disciplinarian</b>. &mdash; The function of
the Disciplinarian must be discussed at length, both because of the
psychological effect upon the men of the manner of the discipline
and of the disciplinarian, and because of the fact that the
disciplinarian is the functional foreman of the four in the
planning department who comes in most personal contact with the
workers, as well as all of the other foremen, and the
Superintendent.</p>
<p>It is important to note, in the discussion that is to follow,
not only how disciplining is transformed as management develops
progressively, but also that the intimate acquaintance of
discipliner with disciplined is not done away with, but rather
supplemented by <!--Page 069--><a name="P069" id="P069"></a> the
standardizing which is the outcome of Scientific Management.</p>
<p>The defects of methods of disciplining under Traditional
Management are remedied, but here, as always, Scientific Management
retains and develops that which is good. This because the good in
the older forms conformed, unconsciously, to the underlying
laws.</p>
<p><b>Defects of Disciplining Under Traditional Management</b>.
&mdash; Under Traditional Management, the disciplining is done by
the foreman; that is, the punishment is meted out by the man who
has charge of all activities of the men under him. This is
actually, in practice and in theory, psychologically wrong. If
there is one man who should be in a state of mind that would enable
him to judge dispassionately, it is the disciplinarian. The man to
be disciplined is usually guilty of one of six offenses:</p>
<p>1. an offense against an employ&eacute; of a grade above
him.</p>
<p>2. an offense against an employ&eacute; of the same grade.</p>
<p>3. an offense against an employ&eacute; of a grade below
him.</p>
<p>4. falling short in the quality of his work.</p>
<p>5. falling short in the quantity of his work.</p>
<p>6. an offense against the system (disobeying orders), falling
down on schedule, or intentionally not co&ouml;perating.</p>
<p>The employ&eacute; over him, or the foreman, to whom he is
supposed to have done some injustice, would be in no state of mind
to judge as to the man's <!--Page 070--><a name="P070" id=
"P070"></a> culpability. In the case of an offense against an
employ&eacute; of the same grade, the best that the injured
employ&eacute; could do would be to appeal to his foreman, who
oftentimes is not an unprejudiced judge, and the multiplicity of
whose duties give him little time to give attention to the subject
of disciplining.</p>
<p>If the offense is against quantity or quality of work, again the
old fashioned foreman, for lack of time, and for lack of training
and proper standards of measurement, will find it almost impossible
to know how guilty the man is, and what form of punishment and what
amount of punishment or loss of opportunity for progress will be
appropriate.</p>
<p><b>Changes in Disciplinarian's Function Under Scientific
Management</b>. &mdash; All this is changed under Scientific
Management. The disciplinarian is a specially appointed functional
foreman, and has few other duties except those that are directly or
indirectly connected with disciplining. He is in touch with the
requirements of the work, because he is in the Planning Department;
he is in touch with the employment bureau, and knows which men
should be employed; he has a determining voice in deciding
elementary rate fixing and should always be consulted before wages
are changed or a reassignment of duties is determined. All of these
are great advantages to him in deciding justly and appropriately
punishments and promotion, not for the workers alone but also for
the foremen and the managers.</p>
<p><b>Duties of the Disciplinarian</b>. &mdash; The Disciplinarian
keeps a record of each man's virtues and defects; he is in position
to know all about the man; where he <!--Page 071--><a name="P071"
id="P071"></a> comes from; what his natural and acquired
qualifications are; what his good points, possibilities and special
fitness are; what his wages are, and his need for them. All that it
is possible for the managers to know of the men is to be
concentrated in this disciplinarian. He is, in practice, more the
counsel and advocate of the worker than an unsympathetic judge, as
is indicated by the fact that his chief function is that of
"diplomat" and "peacemaker." His greatest duty is to see that the
"square deal" is meted out without fear or favor to employer or to
employ&eacute;.</p>
<p><b>Importance of Psychology in Disciplining</b>. &mdash; Not
only does the position of disciplinarian under Scientific
Management answer the psychological requirements for such a
function, but also the holder of the position of disciplinarian
must understand psychology and apply, at least unconsciously, and
preferably consciously, the known laws of psychology, if he wishes
to be successful.</p>
<p>The disciplinarian must consider not only what the man has done
and the relation of this act of his to his other acts; he must also
investigate the cause and the motive of the act, for on the cause
and motive, in reality, depends more than on the act itself. He
must probe into the physical condition of the man, as related to
his mental acts. He must note the effect of the same kind of
discipline under different conditions; for example, he must note
that, on certain types of people, disciplining in the presence of
other people has a most derogatory effect, just as rewards before
people may have a most advantageous effect. Upon others, discipline
that is meted out in the presence of <!--Page 072--><a name="P072"
id="P072"></a> other people is the only sort of discipline which
has the desired effect. The sensitiveness of the person to be
disciplined, the necessity for sharp discipline, and for that
particular sort of discipline which may require the element of
shame in it, must all be considered. He must be able to discover
and note whether the discipline should be meted out to a
ringleader, and whether the other employ&eacute;s, supposed to be
blameworthy, are really only guilty in acquiescing, or in failing
to report one who has really furnished the initiative. He must
differentiate acts which are the result of following a ringleader
blindly from the concerted acts of disobedience of a crowd, for the
"mob spirit" is always an element to be estimated and separately
handled.</p>
<p><b>Inadequacy of Terms in Disciplining</b>. &mdash; The words
"disciplinarian" and "punishment" are most unfortunate. The
"Disciplinarian" would be far better called the "peacemaker," and
the "punishment" by some such word as the "adjustment." It is
<i>not</i> the duty of the disciplinarian to "take out anybody's
grudge" against a man; it <i>is</i> his duty to adjust
disagreements. He must remember constantly that his discipline must
be of such a nature that the result will be for the permanent best
interests of the one disciplined, his co-workers, his associates
and his family.</p>
<p>The aim is, not to put the man down, but to keep him up to his
standard, as will be shown later in a chapter on Incentives. If the
punishment is in the form of a fine, it must not in any way return
to the coffers of the management. The fines collected &mdash;
<!--Page 073--><a name="P073" id="P073"></a> even those fines
collected from the individuals composing the management, should go
in some form to the benefit of the men themselves, such, for
example, as contributions to a workman's sick benefit fund or to
general entertainment at the annual outing of employ&eacute;s. In
practice, the disciplinarian is rather the friend of the worker
than of the employer, if the two interests can possibly be
separated. Again "penalty" is a bad word to use. Any words used in
this connection should preferably have had taken from them any
feeling that personal prejudice affects the discipline. It is the
nature of the offense itself which should prescribe what the
outcome of it shall be.</p>
<p>The position of disciplinarian requires a man who has a keen
sense of justice, who has had such experience as to enable him to
smooth out difficulties until all are in a frame of mind where they
can look upon their own acts and the acts of others calmly. He must
be able so to administer his duties that each decision inspires the
realization that he acted to the best of his knowledge and belief.
He must be one who is fearless, and has no tendency to have
favorites. He must have a clear knowledge of the theories and
principles of Scientific Management, in order that he can fill the
position of enforcer of its laws.</p>
<p><b>The Gang Boss</b>. &mdash; The duties of The Gang Boss are to
see that the worker has plenty of work ahead, to see that
everything that he will need with which to do the work is at hand,
and to see that the work is actually "set," or placed and performed
correctly. This position calls for a practical demonstrator, who
must himself be able and willing actually <!--Page 074--><a name=
"P074" id="P074"></a> to prepare and help on the work. It calls
particularly for a man with teaching ability, with special emphasis
on ability to teach, with great exactness, the prescribed method
and to follow the orders of the planning department implicitly.</p>
<p><b>The Speed Boss</b>. &mdash; The speed boss is responsible for
the methods of doing work with machinery. He has charge of
overseeing the work, and teaching the worker, during the entire
time that the work is being done. He must be prepared constantly to
demonstrate at any time not only <i>how</i> the work is done, but
also that it can be done in the specified time called for in order
to earn the bonus. This position calls for a man who is able,
personally, to carry out the detailed written orders of the
instruction card in regard to speeds, feeds, cuts, methods of
operation, quality and quantity.</p>
<p>He must be proficient at the art of imparting his knowledge to
other workmen, and at the same time be able to secure the
prescribed outputs and quantities. He need not be the fastest
worker in the shop, but he should be one of the most intelligent
workers and best teachers, with a keen desire to co&ouml;perate,
both with the workers and with the other foremen.</p>
<p><b>The Repair Boss</b>. &mdash; The repair boss has charge of
the plant and its maintenance. He must have a natural love of order
and of cleanliness, and a systematic type of mind. This position
calls for a man with an experience that will enable him to detect
liability of breakdowns before they actually occur. He must be
resourceful in repairing unexpected breakdowns in an emergency, and
be able at all times <!--Page 075--><a name="P075" id=
"P075"></a> to carry out literally the directions given on the
instruction cards of the Planning Department for cleaning,
maintaining, and repairing the machines.</p>
<p><b>The Inspector</b>. &mdash; The function of inspector under
scientific or the Taylor plan of management is most important,
especially in connection with the "first inspection." During the
manufacture of the first piece and after it is finished the
inspector passes and reports upon it before the worker proceeds
with the other pieces. Here the worker gets a return in person for
each successive act on the first piece he makes under a new
instruction card, or, if he is a new worker, under an old
instruction card. Ambiguity of instructions, if present, is thus
eliminated, and wrong actions or results are corrected before much
damage to material has been done and before much time and effort
are wasted. The first erroneous cycles of work are not repeated,
and the worker is promptly shown exactly how efficiently he has
succeeded in determining the requirements of his instructions.</p>
<p>The inspector is responsible for the quality of the work. He
fulfills the requirements of Schloss, who says, in speaking of the
danger, under some managements, that the foreman will sacrifice
quality to speed, if he gets a bonus for quantity of output,
&mdash; "The best safeguard against this serious danger would be
found in the appointment of a distinct staff of inspectors whose
duty it should be to ascertain, as the work proceeds, that the
stipulated standards of excellence are at all times scrupulously
maintained." This position of inspector requires an observant man
who naturally is inclined to give constructive rather
<!--Page 076--><a name="P076" id="P076"></a> than
destructive-criticism. He should be a man who can co&ouml;perate
with the workman and foreman to rescue condemned or damaged
material with the least expenditure of time, effort and
expense.</p>
<p><b>Functionalizing the Worker</b>. &mdash; Under Scientific
Management, the worker as well as the foreman, is a specialist.
This he becomes by being relieved of everything that he is not best
fitted to do, and allowed to concentrate upon doing, according to
exact and scientifically derived methods, that work at which he is
an expert.<a href="#ch03fn13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Relieving the Worker of the Planning</b>. &mdash; The
planning is taken away from the worker, not because it is something
too choice, sacred or entertaining for him to do, or something
which the managers desire to do themselves, but because it is best,
for the workers themselves as well as the work, that the planning
be done by specialists at planning. If he is expert enough to plan,
the worker will be promoted to the planning department. In the
meantime, he is working under the best plan that experts can
devise.</p>
<p><b>Master Planning a Life Study</b>. &mdash; The best planner is
he who, &mdash; other things being equal, &mdash; is the most
ingenious, the most experienced and the best observer. It is an art
to observe; it requires persistent attention. The longer and the
more the observer observes, the more details, and variables
affecting details, <!--Page 077--><a name="P077" id="P077"></a>
he observes. The untrained observer could not expect to compete
with one of special natural talent who has also been trained. It is
not every man who is fitted by nature to observe closely, hence to
plan. To observe is a condition precedent to visualizing. Practice
in visualizing makes for increasing the faculty of constructive
imagination. He with the best constructive imagination is the
master planner.</p>
<p>The art of observing is founded on a study of fundamental
elements. In order that planning may be done best, previous to
starting work, the entire sequence of operations must be laid out,
so that the ideas of value of every element of every subdivision of
the process of working may be corrected to act most efficiently in
relation with each and all of the subsequent parts and events that
are to follow. This planning forwards and backwards demands an
equipment of time study, motion study and micro-motion study
records such as can be used economically only when all the planning
is done in one place, with one set of records. The planner must be
able to see and control the whole problem in all of its
aspects.</p>
<p>For example, &mdash; the use that is to be made of the work
after it is completed may entirely change the methods best used in
doing it. Thus, the face of a brick wall that is to be plastered
does not require and should not have the usual excellence of nicely
ruled joints required on a face that is not to be plastered. In
fact, the roughest, raggedest joints will be that quality of wall
that will make the plaster adhere the best.</p>
<!--Page 078--><a name="P078" id="P078"></a>
<p>As an example of professional observation and investigation with
which no untrained observer could compete, we cite the epoch making
work of Dr. Taylor in determining the most efficient speeds, feeds,
cuts and shape of tools to use for the least wastefulness in
cutting metals.<a href="#ch03fn14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Dr. Taylor, an unusually brilliant man, at the end of twenty-six
years, working with the best scientists, engineers, experimenters,
and workmen, after an expenditure of literally hundreds of
thousands of dollars, was able to determine and write down a method
for cutting metals many times less wasteful in time than was ever
known before; but the data from the experiments was so complex and
involved that a considerable knowledge of higher mathematics had to
be used to apply the data. Furthermore, the data was in such form
that it took longer to use the knowledge contained therein than it
did to do the work on any given piece of metal cutting. After
gathering this knowledge, Dr. Taylor, with his assistants, first
Mr. Gantt and finally Mr. Barth, reduced it to such a form that now
it can be used in a matter of a few seconds or minutes. This was
done by making slide rules. <a href="#ch03fn15"><sup>15</sup></a>
Today workers have this knowledge in a form that any machinist can
use with a little instruction. As a result, Dr. Taylor's
observations have revolutionized the design of metal cutting
machinery and the metal cutting industry, and the data
<!--Page 079--><a name="P079" id="P079"></a> he collected is
used in every metal cutting planning department.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a by-product to his observations and
investigations, he discovered the Taylor-White process of making
high speed steel, which revolutionized the steel tool industry. No
untrained workman could expect ever to compete with such work as
this in obtaining results for most efficient planning and at the
same time perform his ordinary work.</p>
<p><b>Wastefulness of Individual Planning</b>. &mdash; Even if it
were possible so to arrange the work of every worker that he could
be in close proximity to the equipment for planning and could be
given the training needed, individual planning for "small lots"
with no systematized standardization of planning-results would be
an economic waste that would cause an unnecessary hardship on the
worker, the employer and the ultimate consumer. Individual planning
could not fit the broad scheme of planning, and at best would cause
delays and confusion, and make an incentive to plan for the
individual self, instead of planning for the greatest good of the
greatest number.</p>
<p>Again, even if it were possible to plan best by individual
planning, there is a further waste in changing from one kind of
work to another. This waste is so great and so obvious that it was
noticed and recognized by the earliest manufacturers and
economists.</p>
<p><b>Hardship to the Worker of Individual Planning</b>. &mdash; To
obtain the most wages and profits there must be the most savings to
divide. These cannot be obtained when each man plans for himself
(except <!--Page 080--><a name="P080" id="P080"></a> in the home
trades), because all large modern operations have the quantity of
output dependent upon the amount of blockades, stoppages and
interferences caused by dependent sequences. It is not, therefore,
possible to obtain the most profit or most wages by individual
planning. Planning is a general function, and the only way to
obtain the best results is by organized planning, and by seeing
that no planning is done for one worker without proper
consideration of its bearing and effect upon any or all the other
men's outputs.</p>
<p><b>The Man Who Desires to Be a Planner Can Be One</b>. &mdash;
If the worker is the sort of a man who can observe and plan, or who
desires to plan, even though he is not at first employed in the
planning department, he is sure to get there finally, as the system
provides that each man shall go where he is best fitted. Positions
in planning departments are hard to fill, because of the scarcity
of men equipped to do this work. The difficulty of teaching men to
become highly efficient planners is one of the reasons for the slow
advance of the general adoption of Scientific Management.</p>
<p><b>The Man Who Dislikes Planning Can Be Relieved</b>. &mdash; It
must not be forgotten that many people dislike the planning
responsibility in connection with their work. For such, relief from
planning makes the performance of the planned work more interesting
and desirable.</p>
<p><b>Provision for Planning by All Under Scientific
Management</b>. &mdash; Much has been said about the worker's
"God-given rights to think," and about the <!--Page 081--><a name=
"P081" id="P081"></a> necessity for providing every worker with
an opportunity to think.</p>
<p>Scientific Management provides the fullest opportunities for
every man to think, to exercise his mental faculties, and to
plan</p>
<p>1. in doing the work itself, as will be shown at length in
chapters that follow.</p>
<p>2. outside of the regular working hours, but in connection with
promotion in his regular work.</p>
<p>Scientific Management provides always, and most emphatically,
that the man shall have hours free from his work in such a state
that he will not be too fatigued to do anything. Furthermore, if he
work as directed, his number of working hours per day will be so
reduced that he will have more time each day for his chosen form of
mental stimulus and improvement.</p>
<p>Our friend John Brashear is a most excellent example of what one
can do in after hours away from his work. He was a laborer in a
steel mill. His duties were not such as resemble in any way
planning or research work, yet he became one of the world's most
prominent astronomical thinkers and an Honorary member of the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers, because he had the desire
to be a student. Under Scientific Management such a desire receives
added impetus from the method of attack provided for through its
teaching.</p>
<p><b>Functionalizing the Work Itself</b>. &mdash; The work of each
part of the planning and performing departments may be
functionalized, or subdivided, as the result of motion study and
time study. The elementary <!--Page 082--><a name="P082" id=
"P082"></a> timed units are combined or synthesized into tasks,
made to fit the capabilities of specialized workers. It is then
necessary to: &mdash;</p>
<p>1. List the duties and requirements of the work.</p>
<p>2. Decide whether the place can be best handled as one, or
subdivided into several further subdivisions, or functions, or even
sub-functions, for two or more function specialists.</p>
<p>For the sake of analysis, all work may be considered as of one
of two classes: &mdash;</p>
<p>1. the short time job.</p>
<p>2. the long time job.</p>
<p>These two divisions are handled differently, as follows:</p>
<p><b>The Short Time Job</b>. &mdash; On the short time job that
probably will never be repeated, there is little opportunity and no
economic reason for specially training a man for its performance.
The available man best suited to do the work with little or no help
should be chosen to do it. The suitability of the man for the work
should be determined only by applying simple tests, or, if even
these will cause costly delay or more expense than the work
warrants, the man who appears suitable and who most desires the
opportunity to do the work can be assigned to it.</p>
<p>If the job is connected with a new art, a man whose habits will
help him can be chosen.</p>
<p>For example: &mdash; in selecting a man to fly, it has been
found advantageous to give a trick bicycle rider the
preference.</p>
<p>There is no other reason why the man for the short job should
not be fitted as well to his work as <!--Page 083--><a name="P083"
id="P083"></a> the man for the long job, except the
all-important reason of cost for special preparation. Any expense
for study of the workers must be borne ultimately both by worker
and management, and it is undesirable to both that expense should
be incurred which will not be ultimately repaid.</p>
<p><b>The Long Time Job</b>. &mdash; The long time job allows of
teaching, therefore applicants for it may be carefully studied.
Usually that man should be chosen who, with all the natural
qualifications and capabilities for the job, except practical
skill, requires the most teaching to raise him from the lower plane
to that highest mental and manual plane which he is able to fill
successfully continuously. In this way each man will be developed
into a worker of great value to the management and to himself.</p>
<p>The man who is capable and already skilled at some work is thus
available for a still higher job, for which he can be taught. Thus
the long job affords the greatest opportunity for promotion. The
long job justifies the expenditure of money, effort and time by
management and men, and is the ideal field for the application of
scientific selection and functionalization.</p>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p><b>Effect of Functionalization upon the Work</b>. &mdash; Under
Traditional Management, there was little or no definite
functionalization. If the quantity of output did increase, as the
result of putting a man at that work for which he seemed best
fitted, there was seldom provision made for seeing that the quality
of <!--Page 084--><a name="P084" id="P084"></a> product was
maintained by a method of constructive inspection that prevented
downward deviations from standard quality, instead of condemning
large quantities of the finished product.</p>
<p>Under Transitory Management, the Department of Inspection is one
of the first Functions installed. This assures maintained quality,
and provides that all increase in output shall be actual gain.</p>
<p>Under Scientific Management, functionalization results in
increased quantity of output, <a href="#ch03fn16"><sup>16</sup></a>
with maintained and usually increased quality. <a href=
"#ch03fn17"><sup>17</sup></a> This results in decreased cost. The
cost is sufficiently lower to allow of increased wages to the
employ&eacute;s, a further profit to the employer, and a
maintained, or lowered, selling price. This means a benefit to the
consumer.</p>
<p>It may be objected that costs cannot be lowered, because of the
number of so-called "non-producers" provided for by Scientific
Management.</p>
<p>In answer to this it may be said that there are no non-producers
under Scientific Management. Corresponding work that, under
Scientific Management, is done in the planning department must all
be done somewhere, in a less systematic manner, even under
Traditional Management. <a href="#ch03fn18"><sup>18</sup></a> The
planning department, <!--Page 085--><a name="P085" id=
"P085"></a> simply does this work more efficiently, &mdash; with
less waste. Moreover, much work of the planning department, being
founded on elementary units, is available for constant use. Here
results an enormous saving by the conservation and utilization of
planning effort.</p>
<p>Also, standard methods are more apt to result in standard
quality, and with less occasion for rejecting output that is below
the requisite standards than is the case under Traditional
Management.</p>
<p><b>Effect of Functionalization upon the Worker</b>. &mdash;
Under Traditional Management, even if the worker often becomes
functionalized, he seldom has assurance that he will be able to
reap the harvest from remaining so, and even so, neither data nor
teaching are provided to enable him to fulfill his function most
successfully.</p>
<p>Under Transitory Management the worker becomes more and more
functionalized, as the results of motion study and time study make
clear the advantages of specializing the worker.</p>
<p><b>Effects upon the Scientifically Managed Worker</b>. &mdash;
Under Scientific Management the effects of Functionalization are so
universal and so far reaching that it is necessary to enumerate
them in detail.</p>
<p><b>Worker Relieved of Everything but His Special Functions</b>.
&mdash; Functionalization, in providing that every man is assigned
a special function, also provides that he be called upon to do work
in that function only, relieving him of all other work and
responsibility. Realization of this elimination has a
<!--Page 086--><a name="P086" id="P086"></a> psychological
effect on action and habits of thinking. <a href=
"#ch03fn19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Places are Provided for Specialists</b>. &mdash;
Functionalization utilizes men with decided bents, and allows each
man to occupy that place for which he is fitted. <a href=
"#ch03fn20"><sup>20</sup></a> Assignment to functions is done
according to the capabilities and desires of those who are to fill
them.</p>
<p><b>Specializing Is Encouraged</b>. &mdash; It is most important
to remember that the man with any special talent or talents,
individuality or special fitness is much more likely, under
Scientific Management, to obtain and retain the place that he is
fitted for than he ever could have been under Traditional
Management, for, while many fairly efficient men can be found who
can fill a general position, a man with the marked desirable trait
necessary to fill a distinct position requiring that trait, will be
one of few, and will have his place waiting for him.</p>
<p><b>One-Talent Men Utilized &mdash; .</b>With Functionalization,
men who lack qualifications for the position which they may, at the
start, endeavor to fill, may be transferred to other positions,
where the qualities they lack are not required. If a man has one
talent, Scientific Management provides a place where that can be
utilized.</p>
<p>For example: &mdash;</p>
<p>Men who cannot produce the prescribed output
<!--Page 087--><a name="P087" id="P087"></a> constantly, are
placed on other work. The slow, unskilled worker who has difficulty
to learn, may be put upon work requiring less skill, or where speed
is not required so much as watchfulness and faithfulness. The
worker who is slow, but exceptionally skilled, has the opportunity
to rise to the position of the functional foreman, especially in
the planning department, where knowledge, experience and
resourcefulness, and especially ability to teach, are much more
desired than speed and endurance. Thus there are places provided,
below and above, that can utilize all kinds of abilities.</p>
<p><b>"All Round" Men Are Utilized</b>. &mdash; The exceptional man
who possesses executive ability in all lines, and balance between
them all, is the ideal man for a manager, and his special "all
round" ability would be wasted in any position below that of a
manager.</p>
<p><b>Stability Provided For</b>. &mdash; Every man is maintained
in his place by his interresponsibility with other men. If he is a
worker, every man's work is held to standard quality by the
inspector, while the requirements and rewards of his function are
kept before him by the instruction card man, rate fixer and the
disciplinarian.</p>
<p><b>Promotion and Development Provided For</b>. &mdash;
Functionalization provides for promotion by showing every man not
only the clearly circumscribed place where he is to work, but also
by showing him the definite place above him to which he may be
promoted and its path, and by teaching him how he can fill it. This
allows him to develop the possibilities <!--Page 088--><a name=
"P088" id="P088"></a> of his best self by using and specially
training those talents which are most marked in him.</p>
<p>Functional Foremanship allows many more people, to become
foremen, and to develop the will and judgment which foremanship
implies.</p>
<p><b>Men in the Organization Preferred to Outsiders</b>. &mdash;
Men in the organization are preferable to outsiders as functional
foremen and for promotion. Not only does a worker's knowledge of
his work help him to become more efficient when he is promoted to
the position of foreman, &mdash; but his efficiency as a teacher is
also increased by the fact that he knows and understands the
workers whom he is there to teach.</p>
<p><b>All Men Are Pushed Up</b>. &mdash; Scientific Management
raises every man as high as he is capable of being raised. It does
not speed him up, but pushes him up to the highest notch which he
can fill. Actual practice has shown that there is a greater demand
for efficient men in the planning department than there is supply;
also, that men in the planning department who fit themselves for
higher work can be readily promoted to positions of greater
responsibility, either inside or outside the organization.</p>
<p><b>Years of Productivity Prolonged</b>. &mdash; Under
Functionalization the number of years of productivity of all,
workers and foremen alike, are increased. The specialty to which
the man is assigned is his natural specialty, thus his possible and
profitable working years are prolonged, because he is at that work
for which he is naturally fitted.</p>
<p>Moreover, the work of teaching is one at which the teacher
becomes more clever and more valuable <!--Page 089--><a name="P089"
id="P089"></a> as time goes on, the functional foreman has that
much more chance to become valuable as years go by.</p>
<p><b>Change in the Worker's Mental Attitude</b>. &mdash; The work
under functionalization is such as to arouse the worker's attention
and to hold his interest. <a href="#ch03fn21"><sup>21</sup></a> But
the most important and valuable change in the worker's feelings is
the change in his attitude towards the foremen and the employer.
From "natural enemies" as sometimes considered under typical
Traditional Management, these all now become friends, with the
common aim, co&ouml;peration, for the purpose of increasing output
and wages, and lowering costs. This change of feeling results in an
appreciation of the value of teaching, and also in promoting
industrial peace.</p>

<h3>MEASUREMENT</h3>
<p><b>Definition of Measurement.</b> &mdash; "Measurement,"
according to the Century Dictionary, &mdash; "is the act of
measuring," and to measure is &mdash; "to ascertain the length,
extent, dimensions, quantity or capacity of, by comparison with a
standard; ascertain or determine a quantity by exact observation,"
or, again, "to estimate or determine the relative extent, greatness
or value of, appraise by comparison with something else."</p>
<p><b>Measurement Important in Psychology.</b> &mdash; Measurement
has always been of importance in psychology; but it is only with
the development of experimental psychology and its special
apparatus, that methods of accurate measurements are available
which make possible the measurement of extremely short periods of
time, or measurements "quick as thought," These enable us to
measure the variations of different workers as to their abilities
and their mental and physical fatigue; <a href=
"#ch04fn01"><sup>1</sup></a> to study mental processes at different
stages of mental and physical growth; to compare different people
under the same conditions, and the same person under different
conditions; <!--Page 091--><a name="P091" id="P091"></a> to
determine the personal coefficient of different workers,
specialists and foremen, and to formulate resultant standards. As
in all other branches of science, the progress comes with the
development of measurement.</p>
<p><b>Methods of Measurement in Psychology.</b> &mdash; No student
of management, and of measurement in the field of management, can
afford not to study, carefully and at length, methods of
measurement under psychology. This, for at least two most important
reasons, which will actually improve him as a measurer, i.e.
&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The student will discover, in the books on experimental
psychology and in the "Psychological Review," a marvelous array of
results of scientific laboratory experiments in psychology, which
will be of immediate use to him in his work.</p>
<p>2. He will receive priceless instruction in methods of
measuring. No where better than in the field of psychology, can one
learn to realize the importance of measurements, the necessity for
determination of elements for study, and the necessity for accurate
apparatus and accuracy in observation.</p>
<p>Prof. George M. Stratton, in his book "Experimental Psychology
and Culture," &mdash; says "In mental measurements, therefore,
there is no pretense of taking the mind's measure as a whole, nor
is there usually any immediate intention of testing even some
special faculty or capacity of the individual. What is aimed at is
the measurement of a limited event in consciousness, such as a
particular perception or feeling. The experiments are addressed, of
course, <!--Page 092--><a name="P092" id="P092"></a> not to the
weight or size of such phenomena, but usually to their duration and
intensity."<a href="#ch04fn02"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The emphasis laid on a study of elements is further shown in the
same book by the following, &mdash; "The actual laboratory work in
time-measurement, however, has been narrowed down to determining,
not the time in general that is occupied by some mental action, but
rather the shortest possible time in which a particular operation,
like discrimination or choice or association or recognition, can be
performed under the simplest and most favorable
circumstances.<a href="#ch04fn03"><sup>3</sup></a> The experimental
results here are something like speed or racing records, made under
the best conditions of track and training. A delicate chronograph
or chronoscope is used, which marks the time in thousandths of a
second."</p>
<p><b>Measurement in Psychology Related to Measurement in
Management.</b> &mdash; Measurement in psychology is of importance
to measurement in management not only as a source of information
and instruction, but also as a justification and support.
Scientific Management has suffered from being called absurd,
impractical, impossible, over-exact, because of the emphasis which
it lays on measurement. Yet, to the psychologist, all present
measurement in Scientific Management must appear coarse, inaccurate
and of immediate and passing value only. With the knowledge that
psychologists endorse accurate measurement, and will co&ouml;perate
in discovering elements <!--Page 093--><a name="P093" id=
"P093"></a> for study, instruments of precision and methods of
investigation, the investigator in industrial fields must persist
in his work with a new interest and confidence. <a href=
"#ch04fn04"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Scientific Management cannot hope to furnish psychology with
either data or methods of measurement. It can and does, however,
open a new field for study to experimental psychology, and shows
itself willing to furnish the actual working difficulties or
problems, to do the preliminary investigation, and to utilize
results as fast as they can be obtained.</p>
<p><b>Psychologists Appreciate Scientific Management.</b> &mdash;
The appreciation which psychologists have shown of work done by
Scientific Management must be not only a matter of gratification,
but of inspiration to all workers in Scientific Management.</p>
<p>So, also, must the new divisions of the Index to the
Psychological Review relating to Activity and Fatigue, and the work
being so extensively done in these lines by French, German, Italian
and other nations, as well as by English and American
psychologists.</p>
<p><b>Measurement Important in Management.</b> &mdash; The study of
individuality and of functionalization have made plain the
necessity of measurement for successful management. Measurement
furnishes the means for obtaining that accurate knowledge upon
which the science of management rests, as do all sciences &mdash;
exact and inexact.<a href="#ch04fn05"><sup>5</sup></a> Through
measurement, methods <!--Page 094--><a name="P094" id=
"P094"></a> of less waste are determined, standards are made
possible, and management becomes a science, as it derives
standards, and progressively makes and improves them, and the
comparisons from them, accurate.</p>
<p><b>Problem of Measurement in Management</b> &mdash; One of the
important problems of measurement in management is determining how
many hours should constitute the working day in each different kind
of work and at what gait the men can work for greatest output and
continuously thrive. The solution of this problem involves the
study of the men, the work, and the methods, which study must
become more and more specialized; but the underlying aim is to
determine standards and individual capacity as exactly as is
possible.<a href="#ch04fn06"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Capacity.</b> &mdash; There are at least four views of a
worker's capacity.</p>
<p>1. What he thinks his capacity is.</p>
<p>2. What his associates think his capacity is.</p>
<p>3. What those over him think his capacity is.</p>
<p>4. What accurate measurement determines his actual capacity to
be.</p>
<p><b>Ignorance of Real Capacity.</b> &mdash; Dr. Taylor has
emphasized the fact that the average workman does not know either
his true efficiency or his true capacity. <a href=
"#ch04fn07"><sup>7</sup></a> The experience of others has also gone
to show that even the skilled workman has little or inaccurate
knowledge of the amount of output that a good
<!--Page 095--><a name="P095" id="P095"></a> worker can achieve
at his chosen vocation in a given time. <a href=
"#ch04fn08"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, &mdash; until a bricklayer has seen his output
counted for several days, he has little idea of how many bricks he
can lay, or has laid, in a day. <a href=
"#ch04fn09"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The average manager is usually even more ignorant of the
capacity of the workers than are the men themselves. <a href=
"#ch04fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> This is because of the prevalence of,
and the actual necessity for the worker's best interest, under some
forms of management, of "soldiering." Even when the manager
realizes that soldiering is going on, he has no way, especially
under ordinary management, of determining its extent.</p>
<p><b>Little Measurement in Traditional Management.</b> &mdash;
Under Traditional Management there was little measurement of a
man's capacity. The emphasis was entirely on the results. There
was, it is true, in everything beyond the most elementary of
Traditional Management, a measurement of the result. The manager
did know, at the end of certain periods of time, how much work had
been done, and how much it had cost him. This was a very important
thing for him to know. If his cost ran too high, and his output
fell too low, he investigated. If he found a defect, he tried to
remedy it; but much time had to be wasted in this investigation,
because often he had no idea where to start in to look for the
defects. The result of the defects was usually the cause for the
inquiry as to their presence.</p>
<!--Page 096--><a name="P096" id="P096"></a>
<p>He might investigate the men, he might investigate the methods,
he might investigate the equipment, he might investigate the
surroundings, and so on, &mdash; and very often in the mind of the
Traditional manager, there was not even this most elementary
division. If things went wrong he simply knew, &mdash; "Something
is wrong somewhere," and it was the work of the foremen to find out
where the place was, or so to speed up the men that the output
should be increased and the cost lowered. Whether the defects were
really remedied, or simply concealed by temporarily speeding up,
was not seriously questioned.</p>
<p>Moreover, until measuring devices are secured, the only standard
is what someone thinks about things, and the pity of it is that
even this condition does not remain staple.</p>
<p><b>Transitory Management Realizes Value of Measurement.</b>
&mdash; One of the first improvements introduced when Traditional
Management gives place to the Transitory stage is the measurement
of the separated output of individual workers. These outputs are
measured and recorded. The records for extra high outputs are
presented to the worker promptly, so that he may have a keen idea
constantly of the relation of effort to output, while the fatigue
and the effort of doing the work is still fresh in his mind.</p>
<p>The psychology of the prompt reward will be considered later at
length, but it cannot be emphasized too often that the prompter the
reward, the greater the stimulus. The reward will become associated
with the fatigue in such a way that the worker will really get, at
the time, more satisfaction out of his <!--Page 097--><a name=
"P097" id="P097"></a> fatigue than he will discomfort; at the
least, any dissatisfaction over his fatigue will be eliminated, by
the constant and first thought of the reward which he has gotten
through his efforts.</p>
<p>This record of efficiency is often so presented to the workers
that they get an excellent idea of the numerical measure of their
efficiency and its trend. This is best done by a graphical
chart.</p>
<p>The records of the outputs of others on the same kind of work
done concurrently, or a corresponding record on work done
previously, will show the relative efficiency of any worker as
compared with the rest. These standards of comparison are a strong
incentive and, if they are shown at the time that such work is
done, they also become so closely associated not only with the
mental but the bodily feeling of the man that the next time the
work is repeated, the thoughts that the same effort will probably
bring greater results, and that it has done so in the past with
others, will be immediately present in the mind.</p>
<p><b>Measurement Is Basic Under Scientific Management.</b> &mdash;
Under Scientific Management measurement is basic. Measurement is of
the work, of outputs, of the methods, the tools, and of the worker,
with the individual as a unit, and motion study, time study and
micro-motion study and the chrono-cyclegraph as the methods of
measurement.</p>
<p>Measurement is a most necessary adjunct to selecting the workers
and the managers and to assigning them to the proper functions and
work. They cannot be selected to the greatest advantage and set to
functionalized work until &mdash;</p>
<!--Page 098--><a name="P098" id="P098"></a>
<p class="ltritem">(a) the unit of measurement that will of itself
tend to reduce costs has been determined.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) methods of measurement have been
determined.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(c) measurement has been applied.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(d) standards for measurement have been
derived.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(e) devices for cheapening the cost of measuring
have been installed.</p>
<p><b>Under Scientific Management Measurement Determines the
Task.</b> &mdash; An important aim of measurement under Scientific
Management is to determine the Task, or the standard amount of any
kind of work that a first class man can do in a certain period of
time. The "standard amount" is the largest amount that a first
class man can do and continuously thrive.</p>
<p>The "first-class" man is the man who can eventually become best
fitted, by means of natural and acquired capabilities, to do the
work. The "certain period of time" is that which best suits the
work and the man's thriving under the work. The amount of time
allowed for a task consists of three parts &mdash;</p>
<p>1. time actually spent at work.</p>
<p>2. time for rest for overcoming fatigue.</p>
<p>3. time for overcoming delays.</p>
<p>Measurement must determine what percentage of the task time is
to be spent at work and what at rest, and must also determine
whether the rest period should all follow the completed work, or
should be divided into parts, these parts to follow certain cycles
through the entire work period.</p>
<!--Page 099--><a name="P099" id="P099"></a>
<p>The method of constructing the task is discussed under two
chapters that follow, Analysis and Synthesis, and Standardization.
Here we note only that the task is built up of elementary units
measured by motion study, time study, and micro-motion study.</p>
<p>When this standard task has been determined the worker's
efficiency can be measured by his performance of, or by the amount
that he exceeds, the task.</p>
<p><b>Qualifications of the Observer or Measurer.</b> &mdash; The
position of observer, or as he has well been called, "trade
revolutionizer," should be filled by a man specially selected for
the position on account of his special natural fitness and previous
experience. He also should be specially trained for his work. As in
all other classes of work, the original selection of the man is of
vital importance. The natural qualities of the successful hunter,
fisherman, detective, reporter and woodsman for observation of
minute details are extremely desirable. It is only by having
intimate knowledge of such experiences as Agassiz had with his
pupils, or with untrained "observers" of the trade, that one can
realize the lack of powers of observation of detail in the average
human being.</p>
<p>Other natural qualifications required to an efficient observer
are that of being</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) an "eye worker";</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) able to concentrate attention for unusually
long periods;</p>
<p class="ltritem">(c) able to get every thought out of a simple
written sentence; <!--Page 100--><a name="P100" id=
"P100"></a></p>
<p class="ltritem">(d) keenly interested in his work;</p>
<p class="ltritem">(e) accurate;</p>
<p class="ltritem">(f) possessed of infinite patience;</p>
<p class="ltritem">(g) an enthusiastic photographer.</p>
<p>The measurer or observer should, preferably, have the intimate
knowledge that comes from personal experience of the work to be
observed, although such a man is often difficult if not impossible
to obtain.</p>
<p>The position of observer illustrates another of the many
opportunities of the workmen for promotion from the ranks to higher
positions when they are capable of holding the promotion.
Naturally, other things being equal, no man is so well acquainted
with the work to be observed as he who has actually done it
himself, and if he have also the qualifications of the worker at
the work, which should, in the future, surely be determined by
study of him and by vocational guidance, he will be able to go at
once from his position in the ranks to that of observer, or time
study man.</p>
<p>The observer must also familiarize himself with the literature
regarding motion study and time study, and must form the habit of
recording systematically the minutest details observable.</p>
<p>The effect upon the man making the observation of knowing that
his data, even though at the time they may seem unimportant, can be
used for the deduction of vital laws, is plain. He naturally feels
that he is a part of a permanent scheme, and is ready and willing
to put his best activity into the work. The benefits accruing from
this fact have been so well recognized in making United States
surveys and <!--Page 101--><a name="P101" id="P101"></a> charts,
that the practice has been to have the name of the man in charge of
the work printed on them.</p>
<p><b>Anyone Interested May Become an Observer.</b> &mdash; A
review of the mental equipment needed by a measurer, or observer,
will show that much may be done toward training oneself for such a
position by practice. Much pleasure as well as profit can be
obtained by acquiring the habit of observation, both in the regular
working and in the non-working hours. Vocational Guidance Bureaus
should see that this habit of observation is cultivated, not only
for the &aelig;sthetic pleasure which it gives, but also for its
permanent usefulness.</p>
<p><b>Unbiased Observation Necessary.</b> &mdash; In order to take
observations properly, the investigator should be absolutely
impartial, unprejudiced, and unbiased by any preconceived notions.
Otherwise, he will be likely to think that a certain thing ought to
happen. Or he may have a keen desire to obtain a certain result to
conform to a pet theory. In other words, the observer must be of a
very stable disposition. He must not be carried away by his
observations.</p>
<p>The elimination of any charting by the man who makes the
observations, or at least its postponement until all observations
are made, will tend to decrease the dangers of unconscious effect
of what he considers the probable curve of the observations should
be.</p>
<p>As has been well said, watching the curve to be charted before
all of the data have been obtained develops a distinct theory in
the mind of the investigator and is apt to "bend the curve" or, at
least, to <!--Page 102--><a name="P102" id="P102"></a> develop a
feeling that if any new, or special, data do not agree with the
tendency of the curve &mdash; so much the worse for the reputation
of the data for reliability.</p>
<p><b>Observed Worker Should Realize the Purpose of the
Measurement.</b> &mdash; The observed worker should be made to
realize the purpose and importance of the measurement. The
observing should always be done with his full knowledge and hearty
co&ouml;peration. He will attain much improvement by intelligent
co&ouml;peration with the observer, and may, in turn, be able to be
promoted to observing if he is interested enough to study and
prepare himself after hours.</p>
<p><b>Worker Should Never Be Observed Surreptitiously.</b> &mdash;
No worker should ever be observed, timed and studied
surreptitiously. In the first place, if the worker does not know
that he is being observed, he cannot co&ouml;perate with the
observer to see that the methods observed are methods of least
waste. Therefore the motion study and time study records that
result will not be fundamental standards in any case and will
probably be worthless.</p>
<p>In the second place, if the worker discovers that he is being
observed secretly, he will feel that he is being spied upon and is
not being treated fairly. The stop watch has too long been
associated with the idea of "taking the last drop of blood from the
worker." Secret observations will tend strongly to lend credence to
this idea. Even should the worker thus observed not think that he
was being watched in order to force him, at a later time, to make
higher outputs, after he has once learned that he is being
<!--Page 103--><a name="P103" id="P103"></a> watched secretly,
his attention will constantly be distracted by the thought that
perhaps he is being studied and timed again. He will be constantly
on the alert to see possible observers. This may result in
"speeding him up," but the speed will not be a legitimate speed,
that results to his good as well as to that of his employer.</p>
<p>Worst of all, he will lose confidence in the "squareness" of his
employer. Hence he will fail to co-operate, and one of the greatest
advantages of Scientific Management will thus be lost.</p>
<p>It is a great advantage of micro-motion study that it demands
co&ouml;peration of the man studied, and that its results are open
to study by all.</p>
<p><b>An Expert Best Worker to Observe.</b> &mdash; The best worker
to observe for time study is he who is so skilled that he can
perform a cycle of prescribed standard motions automatically,
without mental concentration. This enables him to devote his entire
mental activity to deviating the one desired variable from the
accepted cycle of motions.</p>
<p>The difficulty in motion study and time study is not so often to
vary the variable being observed and studied, as it is to maintain
the other variables constant. Neither skill nor appreciation of
what is wanted is enough alone. The worker who is to be measured
successfully must</p>
<p>1. have the required skill.</p>
<p>2. understand the theory of what is being done.</p>
<p>3. be willing to co&ouml;perate.</p>
<p><b>Everyone Should Be Trained in Being Measured.</b> &mdash;
Accurate measurement of individuals, in actual practice,
<!--Page 104--><a name="P104" id="P104"></a> brings out the fact
that lamentably few persons are accustomed to be, or can readily
be, measured. It has been a great drawback to the advance of
Scientific Management that the moment a measurer of any kind is put
on the work, either a device to measure output or a man to measure
or to time reactions, motions, or output, the majority of the
workers become suspicious. Being unaccustomed to being measured,
they think, as is usually the case with things to which we are
unaccustomed, that there is something harmful to them in it. This
feeling makes necessary much explanation which in reality should
not be needed.</p>
<p>The remedy for this condition is a proper training in youth. A
boy brought up with the fundamental idea of the importance of
measurement to all modern science, for all progress, accustomed to
being measured, understanding the "why" of the measuring, and the
results from it, will not hesitate or object, when he comes to the
work, to being measured in order that he may be put where it is
best for himself, as well as for the work, that he be put.</p>
<p>The importance of human measurement to vocational guidance and
to the training of the young for life work has never been properly
realized. Few people understand the importance of psychological
experiment as a factor in scientific vocational guidance. For this
alone, it will probably in time be a general custom to record and
keep as close track as possible of the psychological measurements
of the child during the period of education, vocational guidance
and apprenticeship. Not only this, but he also should be
<!--Page 105--><a name="P105" id="P105"></a> accustomed to being
measured, physically and psychologically, from his first years,
just as he is now accustomed to being weighed.</p>
<p>The child should be taught to measure himself, his faculties,
his reactions, his capabilities as compared with his former self
and as compared with the capabilities of others. It is most
important that the child should form a habit not only of measuring,
but of being measured.</p>
<p><b>Motion Study and Time Study Are the Method of Measurement
Under Scientific Management.</b> &mdash; Under Scientific
Management, much measuring is done by motion study and time study,
which measure the relative efficiency of various men, of various
methods, or of various kinds of equipment, surroundings, tools,
etc. Their most important use is as measuring devices of the men.
They have great psychological value in that they are founded on the
"square deal" and the men know this from the start. Being operated
under laws, they are used the same way on all sorts of work and on
all men. As soon as the men really understand this fact, and
realize</p>
<p>1. that the results are applied to all men equally;</p>
<p>2. that all get an ample compensation for what they do;</p>
<p>3. that under them general welfare is considered; the objections
to such study will vanish.</p>
<p><b>Motion Study Is Determining Methods of Least Waste.</b>
&mdash; Motion Study is the dividing of the elements of the work
into the most fundamental subdivisions possible; studying these
fundamental units separately and in relation to one another; and
from <!--Page 106--><a name="P106" id="P106"></a> these studied,
chosen units, when timed, building up methods of least waste.</p>
<p><b>Time Study Is Determining Standard Unit Times.</b> &mdash;
Time study consists of timing the elements of the best method
known, and, from these elementary unit times, synthesizing a
standard time in which a standard man can do a certain piece of
work in accordance with the finally accepted method.</p>
<p>Micro-motion study is timing sub-divisions, or elements of
motions by carrying out the principles of motion study to a greater
degree of accuracy by means of a motion picture camera, a clock
that will record different times of day in each picture of a moving
picture film together with a cross sectioned background and other
devices for assisting in measuring the relative efficiency and
wastefulness of motions. It also is the cheapest, quickest and more
accurate method of recording indisputable time study records. It
has the further advantage of being most useful in assisting the
instruction card man to devise methods of least waste. <a href=
"#ch04fn11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Motion Study and Time Study Measure Individual
Efficiency.</b> &mdash; Motion Study and Time Study measure
individual capacity or efficiency by providing data from which
standards can be made. These standards made, the degree to which
the individual approaches or exceeds the standard can be
determined.</p>
<p><b>Motion Study and Time Study Measure Methods.</b> &mdash;
Motion Study and Time Study are devices for measuring methods. By
their use, old methods are "tried out," once and for all, and their
relative value <!--Page 107--><a name="P107" id="P107"></a> in
efficiency, determined. By their use, also, new methods are "tried
out." This is most important under Scientific Management.</p>
<p>Any new method suggested can be tested in a short time. Such
elements of it as have already been tested, can be valued at the
start, the new elements introduced can be motion studied and time
studied, and waste eliminated to as great an extent as possible,
with no loss of time or thought.</p>
<p>Under Scientific Management, the men who understand what motion
study and time study mean, know that their suggested methods will
be tested, not only fairly, but so effectively that they, and
everyone else, can know at once exactly the worth of their
suggestions.</p>
<p><b>Comparison of Methods Fosters Invention.</b> &mdash; The
value of such comparative study can be seen at a glance. When one
such method after another is tried out, not only can one tell
quickly what a new method is worth, but can also determine what it
is worth compared to all others which have been considered. This is
because the study is a study of elements, primarily, and not of
methods as a whole. Not only can suggested methods be estimated,
but also new methods which have never been suggested will become
apparent themselves through this study. Common elements, being at
once classified and set aside, the new ones will make themselves
prominent, and better methods for doing work will suggest
themselves, especially to the inventive mind.</p>
<p><b>Books of Preliminary Data Needed.</b> &mdash; In order that
this investigation may be best fostered, not only must
<!--Page 108--><a name="P108" id="P108"></a> books of standards
be published, but also books of preliminary data, which other
workers may attack if they desire, and where they can find common
elements. Such books of preliminary data are needed on all
subjects.&gt;<a href="#ch04fn12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Motion Study and Time Study Measure Equipment and Tools.</b>
&mdash; Time and motion study are measuring devices for
ascertaining relative merits of different kinds of equipment,
surroundings and tools. Through them, the exact capacities of
equipment or of a tool or machine can be discovered at once, and
also the relative value in efficiency. Also motion study and time
study determine exactly how a tool or a piece of equipment can best
be used.</p>
<p>In "On The Art of Cutting Metals" Dr. Taylor explains the effect
of such study on determining the amount of time that tools should
be used, the speed at which they should be used, the feed, and so
on.<a href="#ch04fn13"><sup>13</sup></a> This paper exemplifies
more thoroughly than does anything else ever written the value of
Time Study, and the scientific manner in which it is applied.</p>
<p><b>The Scope of Time and Motion Study Is Unlimited.</b> &mdash;
It is a great misfortune that the worker does not understand, as he
should, that motion study and time study apply not only to his
work, but also to the work of the managers. In order to get results
from the start, and paying results, it often happens that the work
of the worker is the first to be <!--Page 109--><a name="P109" id=
"P109"></a> so studied, but when Scientific Management is in
full operation, the work of the managers is studied exactly to the
same extent, and set down exactly as accurately, as the work of the
worker himself. The worker should understand this from the start,
that he may become ready and willing to co&ouml;perate.</p>
<p><b>Detailed Records Necessary.</b> &mdash; Motion study and time
study records must go into the greatest detail possible. If the
observations are hasty, misdirected or incomplete they may be quite
unusable and necessitate going through the expensive process of
observation all over again. Dr. Taylor has stated that during his
earlier experiences he was obliged to throw away a large quantity
of time study data, because they were not in sufficient detail and
not recorded completely enough to enable him to use them after a
lapse of a long period from the time of their first use. No system
of time study, and no individual piece of time study, can be
considered a success unless by its use at any time, when new, or
after a lapse of years, an accurate prediction of the amount of
work a man can do can be made.</p>
<p>All results attained should invariably be preserved, whether
they appear at the moment to be useful or valuable or not. In time
study in the past it has been found, as in the investigations of
all other sciences, that apparently unimportant details of today
are of vital importance years after, as a necessary step to attain,
or further proof of a discovery. This was exemplified in the case
of the shoveling experiment of Dr. Taylor. The laws came from what
was considered the unimportant portion of the
<!--Page 110--><a name="P110" id="P110"></a> data. There is
little so unimportant that time and motion study would not be
valuable. Just as it is a great help to the teacher to know the
family history of the student, so it is to the one who has to use
time and motion study data to know all possible of the hereditary
traits, environment and habits of the worker who was observed.</p>
<p><b>Specialized Study Imperative.</b> &mdash; As an illustration
of the field for specialized investigation which motion study and
time study present, we may take the subject of fatigue. Motion
Study and Time Study aim to show,</p>
<p>1. the least fatiguing method of getting least waste.</p>
<p>2. the length of time required for a worker to do a certain
thing.</p>
<p>3. the amount of rest and the time of rest required to overcome
fatigue.</p>
<p>Dr. Taylor spent years in determining the percentage of rest
that should be allowed in several of the trades, beginning with
those where the making of output demands weight hanging on the
arms; but there is still a great amount of investigation that could
be done to advantage to determine the most advisable percentage of
rest in the working day of different lengths of hours. Such
investigation would probably show that many of our trades could do
the same amount of work in fewer hours, if the quantity and time of
rest periods were scientifically determined.</p>
<p>Again, there is a question of the length of each rest period. It
has been proven that in many classes <!--Page 111--><a name="P111"
id="P111"></a> of work, and especially in those where the work
is interrupted periodically by reason of its peculiar nature, or by
reason of inefficient performance in one of the same sequence of
dependent operations, alternate working and resting periods are
best. There is to be considered in this connection, however, the
recognized disadvantage of reconcentrating the attention after
these rest periods. Another thing to be considered is that the rate
of output does not decline from the beginning of the day, but
rather the high point of the curve representing rate of production
is at a time somewhat later than at the starting point. The period
before the point of maximum efficiency is known as "warming up"
among ball players, and is well recognized in all athletic
sports.</p>
<p>As for the point of minimum efficiency, or of greatest fatigue,
this varies for "morning workers," and "night workers." This
exemplifies yet another variable.</p>
<p>The minuteness of the sub-fields that demand observation, is
shown by an entry in the Psychological Index: "1202. Benedict, F.G.
"Studies in Body &mdash; Temperature." 1. Influence of the
Inversion of the Daily Routine; the Temperature of Night
Workers."<a href="#ch04fn14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Selection of Best Unit of Measurement Necessary and
Important.</b> &mdash; Selecting the unit of measurement that will
of itself reduce costs is a most important element in obtaining
maximum efficiency.<a href="#ch04fn15"><sup>15</sup></a> This is
seldom <!--Page 112--><a name="P112" id="P112"></a> realized.
<a href="#ch04fn16"><sup>16</sup></a> Where possible, several units
of measurements should be used to check each other. <a href=
"#ch04fn17"><sup>17</sup></a> One alone may be misleading, or put
an incentive on the workers to give an undesirable result.</p>
<p>The rule is, &mdash; always select that unit of output that
will, of itself, cause a reduction in costs.</p>
<p>For example: &mdash; In measuring the output of a concrete gang,
counting cement bags provides an incentive to use more cement than
the instruction card calls for. Counting the batches of concrete
dumped out of the mixer, provides an incentive to use rather
smaller quantities of broken stone and sand than the proportions
call for, &mdash; and, furthermore, does not put the incentive on
the men to spill no concrete in transportation, neither does it put
an incentive to use more lumps for Cyclopean concrete.</p>
<p>Measuring the quantity actually placed in the forms puts no
incentive to watch bulging forms closely.</p>
<p>While measuring outputs by all these different units of
measurements would be valuable to check up accuracy of proportions,
accuracy of stores account, and output records, the most important
unit of measurement for selection would be, "cubic feet of forms
filled," the general dimensions to be taken from the latest revised
engineer's drawings.</p>
<p><b>Necessity for Checking Errors.</b> &mdash; Dr. Stratton says,
&mdash; "No measurements, whether they be psychic or physical, are
exact beyond a certain point, and the art of using them consists
largely in checks and counter checks, and in knowing how far the
measurement <!--Page 113--><a name="P113" id="P113"></a> is
reliable and where the doubtful zone begins." <a href=
"#ch04fn18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Capt. Metcalfe says, &mdash; "Errors of observation may be
divided into two general classes; the instrumental and those due to
the personal bias of the observer; the former referring to the
standard itself, and the latter to the application of the standard
and the record of the measurement." <a href=
"#ch04fn19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The concrete illustration given above is an example of careful
checking up. Under Scientific Management so many, and such careful
records are kept that detecting errors becomes part of the daily
routine.</p>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p><b>Results of Measurement to the Work.</b> &mdash; Under
Traditional Management, even the crudest measurement of output and
cost usually resulted in an increase in output. But there was no
accuracy of measurement of individual efficiency, nor was there
provision made to conserve results and make them permanently
useful.</p>
<p>Under Transitory Management and measurement of individual
output, output increased and rewards for the higher output kept up
the standard.</p>
<p><b>Under Scientific Management Better Methods and Better Work
Results.</b> &mdash; Under Scientific Measurement, measurement of
the work itself determines</p>
<p>1. what kind of workers are needed.</p>
<p>2. how many workers are needed.</p>
<p>3. how best to use them.</p>
<!--Page 114--><a name="P114" id="P114"></a>
<p>Motion Study and Time Study measurement, &mdash;</p>
<p>1. divide the work into units.</p>
<p>2. measure each unit.</p>
<p>3. study the variables, or elements, one at a time.</p>
<p>4. furnish resulting timed elements to the synthesizer of
methods of least waste.</p>
<p><b>Accurate Measuring Devices Prevent Breakdowns and
Accidents.</b> &mdash; The accurate measuring devices which
accomplish measurement under Scientific Management prevent
breakdowns and accidents to life and limb.</p>
<p>For example. &mdash;</p>
<p>1. The maintained tension on a belt bears a close relation to
its delay periods.</p>
<p>2. The speed of a buzz planer determines its liability to shoot
out pieces of wood to the injury of its operator, or to injure
bystanders.</p>
<p>Scientific Management, by determining and standardizing methods
and equipment both, provides for uninterrupted output.</p>
<p><b>Effect on the Worker.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional
Management there is not enough accurate measurement done to make
its effect on the worker of much value.</p>
<p>Under Transitory Management, as soon as individual outputs are
measured, the worker takes more interest in his work, and endeavors
to increase his output.</p>
<p>Under Scientific Management measurement of the worker tells</p>
<p>1. what the workers are capable of doing.</p>
<p>2. what function it will be best to assign them to and to
cultivate in them.</p>
<!--Page 115--><a name="P115" id="P115"></a>
<p><b>Waste Eliminated by Accurate Measurement.</b> &mdash; This
accurate measurement increases the worker's efficiency in that it
enables him to eliminate waste. "Cut and try" methods are
eliminated. There is no need to test a dozen methods, a dozen men,
a dozen systems of routing, or various kinds of equipment more than
once, &mdash; that one time when they are scientifically tried out
and measured. This accurate measurement also eliminates disputes
between manager and worker as to what the latter's efficiency
is.</p>
<p><b>Efficiency Measured by Time and Motion Study.</b> &mdash;
Time and Motion Study.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) measure the man by his work; that is, by the
results of his activities;</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) measure him by his methods;</p>
<p class="ltritem">(c) measure him by his capacity to learn;</p>
<p class="ltritem">(d) measure him by his capacity to teach.</p>
<p>Now measurement by result alone is very stimulating to
increasing activities, especially when it shows, as it does under
Scientific Management, the relative results of various people doing
the same kind of work. But it does not, itself, show the worker
<i>how</i> to obtain greater results without putting on more speed
or using up more activities. But when the worker's methods are
measured, he begins to see, for himself, exactly why and where he
has failed.</p>
<p>Scientific Management provides for him to be taught, and the
fact that he sees through the measurements exactly what he needs to
be taught will make him glad to have the teacher come and show him
how to do better. Through this teaching, its results, and the speed
with which the results come, the <!--Page 116--><a name="P116" id=
"P116"></a> workers and the managers can see how fast the worker
is capable of learning, and, at the same time, the worker, the
teacher and the managers can see in how far the foreman is capable
of instructing.</p>
<p><b>Final Outcome Beneficial to Managers and Men.</b> &mdash;
Through measurement in Scientific Management, managers acquire
&mdash;</p>
<p>1. ability to select men, methods, equipment, etc.;</p>
<p>2. ability to assign men to the work which they should do, to
prescribe the method which they shall use, and to reward them for
their output suitably;</p>
<p>3. ability to predict. On this ability to predict rests the
possibility of making calendars, chronological charts and
schedules, and of planning determining sequence of events, etc.,
which will be discussed at length later.</p>
<p>Ability to predict allows the managers to state "premature
truths," which the records show to be truths when the work has been
done.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that the managers are enabled not only
to predict what the men, equipment, machinery, etc., will do, but
what they can do themselves.</p>
<p><b>The Effect on the Men Is That the Worker Co-operates.</b>
&mdash; 1. The worker's interest is held. The men know that the
methods they are using are the best. The exact measurements of
efficiency of the learner, &mdash; and under Scientific Management
a man never ceases to be a learner, &mdash; give him a continued
interest in his work. It is impossible to hold the attention of the
intelligent worker to a method or process <!--Page 117--><a name=
"P117" id="P117"></a> that he does not believe to&gt; be the
most efficient and least wasteful.</p>
<p>Motion study and time study are the most efficient measuring
device of the relative qualities of differing methods. They furnish
definite and exact proof to the worker as to the excellence of the
method that he is told to use. When he is convinced, lack of
interest due to his doubts and dissatisfaction is removed.</p>
<p>2. The worker's judgment is appealed to. The method that he uses
is the outcome of co&ouml;peration between him and the management.
His own judgment assures him that it is the best, up to that time,
that they, working together, have been able to discover.</p>
<p>3. The worker's reasoning powers are developed. Continuous
judging of records of efficiency develops high class, well
developed reasoning powers.</p>
4. The worker fits his task, therefore there is no need of
adjustment, and his attitude toward his work is right.<br />
<br />
<p>5. There is elimination of soldiering, both natural and
systematic.<a href="#ch04fn20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><b>All Knowledge Becomes the Knowledge of All.</b> &mdash; Two
outcomes may be confidently expected in the future, as they are
already becoming apparent where-ever Scientific Management is being
introduced:</p>
<p>1. The worker will become more and more willing
<!--Page 118--><a name="P118" id="P118"></a> to impart his
knowledge to others. When the worker realizes that passing on his
trade secrets will not cause him to lose his position or, by
raising up a crowd of competitors, lower his wages, but will, on
the contrary, increase his wages and chances of promotion, he is
ready and willing to have his excellent methods standardized.</p>
<p>Desire to keep one's own secret, or one's own method a secret is
a very natural one. It stimulates interest, it stimulates pride. It
is only when, as in Scientific Management, the possessor of such a
secret may receive just compensation, recognition and honor for his
skill, and receive a position where he can become an appreciated
teacher of others that he is, or should be, willing to give up this
secret. Scientific Management, however, provides this opportunity
for him to teach, provides that he receives credit for what he has
done, and receive that publicity and fame which is his due, and
which will give him the same stimulus to work which the knowledge
that he had a secret skill gave him in the past.</p>
<p>One method of securing this publicity is by naming the device or
method after its inventor. This has been found to be successful not
only in satisfying the inventor, but in stimulating others to
invent.</p>
<p><b>Measurement of Individual Efficiency Will Be Endorsed by
All.</b> &mdash; 2. The worker will, ultimately, realize that it is
for the good of all, as well as for himself, that individual
efficiency be measured and rewarded.</p>
<p>It has been advanced as an argument against measurement that it
discriminates against the "weaker brother," who should have a right
to obtain the same <!--Page 119--><a name="P119" id="P119"></a>
pay as the stronger, for the reason that he has equal needs for
this pay to maintain life and for the support of his family.</p>
<p>Putting aside at the moment the emotional side of this argument,
which is undoubtedly a strong side and a side worthy of
consideration, with much truth in it, and looking solely at the
logical side, &mdash; it cannot do the "weaker" brother any good in
the long run, and it does the world much harm, to have his work
overestimated. The day is coming, when the world will demand that
the quantity of the day's work shall be measured as accurately
where one sells labor, as where one sells sugar or flour. Then,
pretending that one's output is greater than it really is will be
classed with "divers weights and divers measures," with their false
standards. The day will come when the public will insist that the
"weaker brother's" output be measured to determine just how weak he
is, and whether it is weakness, unfitness for that particular job,
or laziness that is the cause of his output being low. When he
reaches a certain degree of weakness, he will be assisted with a
definite measured quantity of assistance. Thus the "weaker brother"
may be readily distinguished from the lazy, strong brother, and the
brother who is working at the wrong job. Measurement should
certainly be insisted on, in order to determine whether these
strong brothers are doing their full share, or whether they are
causing the weaker brothers to over-exert themselves.</p>
<p>No one who has investigated the subject properly can doubt that
it will be better for the world in general <!--Page 120--><a name=
"P120" id="P120"></a> to have each man's output, weak and
strong, properly measured and estimated regardless of whether the
weak and strong are or are not paid the same wages. The reason why
the unions have had to insist that the work shall not be measured
and that the weaker brother's weakness shall not be realized is,
that in the industrial world the only brotherhood that was
recognized was the brotherhood between the workers, there being a
distinct antagonism between the worker and the manager and little
or no brotherhood of the public at large. When Scientific
Management does away, as it surely will, with this antagonism, by
reason of the co&ouml;peration which is its fundamental idea, then
the workers will show themselves glad to be measured.</p>
<p>As for the "weaker" brother idea, it is a natural result of such
ill treatment. It has become such a far-reaching emotion that even
Scientific Management, with its remedy for many ills, cannot expect
in a moment, or in a few years, to alter the emotional bias of the
multitudes of people who have held it for good and sufficient
reasons for generations.</p>
<p><b>The Government Should Conserve Measurement Data.</b> &mdash;
The one thing which can permanently alter this feeling forms the
natural conclusion to this chapter. That is, measurements in
general and motion study and time study in particular must become a
matter of government investigation. When the government has taken
over the investigation and established a bureau where such data as
Scientific Management discovers is collected and kept on file for
all who <!--Page 121--><a name="P121" id="P121"></a> will to
use, then the possessor of the secret will feel that it can safely
place the welfare of its "weaker brothers" in the hands of a body
which is founded and operates on the idea of the "square deal."</p>
<p><b>Appreciation of Time Study by Workers the First Step.</b>
&mdash; The first step of the workers in this direction must be the
appreciation of time study, for on time study hangs the entire
subject of Scientific Management. It is this great discovery by Dr.
Taylor that makes the elimination of waste possible. It has come to
stay. Many labor leaders are opposed to it, but the wise thing for
them to do is to study, foster and cultivate it. They cannot stop
its progress. There is no thing that can stop it. The modern
managers will obtain it, and the only way to prevent it from being
used by unscrupulous managers is for the workman also to learn the
facts of time study. It is of the utmost importance to the workers
of the country, for their own protection, that they be as familiar
with time study data as the managers are. Time study is the
foundation and frame work of rate setting and fixing, and certainly
the subject of rate fixing is the most important subject there is
to the workmen, whether they are working on day work, piece work,
premium, differential rate piece, task with bonus, or three-rate
system.</p>
<p>Dr. Taylor has proved by time study that many of the customary
working days are too long, that the same amount of output can be
achieved in fewer hours per day. Time study affords the means for
the only scientific proof that many trades fatigue the workers
beyond their endurance and strength. <!--Page 122--><a name="P122"
id="P122"></a> Time study is the one means by which the workers
can prove the real facts of their unfortunate condition under the
Traditional plan of management.</p>
<p>The workers of the country should be the very ones that should
insist upon the government taking the matter in hand for scientific
investigation. Knowledge is power, &mdash; a rule with no
exception, and the knowledge of scientific time study would prepare
the workers of any trade, and would provide their intelligent
leaders with data for accurate decisions for legislation and other
steps for their best interests. The national bodies should hire
experts to represent them and to co&ouml;perate with the government
bureau in applying science to their life work.</p>
<p>The day is fast approaching when makers of machinery will have
the best method of operating their machines micro-motion studied
and cyclegraphed and description of methods of operation in
accordance with such records will be everywhere considered as a
part of the "makers' directions for using."</p>
<p>Furthermore associations of manufacturers will establish
laboratories for determining methods of least waste by means of
motion study, time study and micro-motion study, and the findings
of such laboratories will be put in standardized shape for use by
all its members. The trend today shows that soon there will be
hundreds of books of time study tables. The government must sooner
or later save the waste resulting from this useless duplication of
efforts.</p>

<h3><a name="chapterv" id="chapterv">CHAPTER V</a></h3>
<h3>ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS</h3>
<p><b>Definition of Analysis.</b> &mdash; "Analysis," says the
Century Dictionary is "the resolution or separation of anything
which is compound, as a conception, a sentence, a material
substance or an event, into its constituent elements or into its
causes;" that is to say, analysis is the division of the thing
under consideration into its definite cause, and into its definite
parts or elements, and the explanation of the principle upon which
such division is made.<a href="#ch05fn01"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Definition of Synthesis.</b> &mdash; "Synthesis" is, "a
putting of two or more things together; composition; specifically,
the combination of separate elements of objects of thought into a
whole, as of simple into compound or complex conceptions, and
individual propositions into a system."</p>
<p><b>Use of Analysis and Synthesis by Psychology.</b> &mdash;
Analysis is defined by Sully as follows: "Analysis" is "taking
apart more complex processes in order to single out for special
inspection their several constituent processes."</p>
<p>He divides elements of thought activity into two</p>
<p class="ltritem">"(a) analysis: abstraction</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) synthesis: comparison."
<!--Page 124--><a name="P124" id="P124"></a></p>
<p>Speaking of the latter, he says, "The clear explicit detachment
in thought of the common elements which comparison secures allows
of a new reconstructive synthesis of things as made up of
particular groupings of a number of general qualities."</p>
<p><b>Place of Analysis and Synthesis in Management.</b> &mdash;
Any study of management which aims to prove that management may be,
and under Scientific Management is, a science, must investigate its
use of analysis and of synthesis. <a href=
"#ch05fn02"><sup>2</sup></a> Upon the degree and perfection of the
analysis depends the permanent value and usefulness of the
knowledge gained. Upon the synthesis, and what it includes and
excludes, depends the efficiency of the results deduced.</p>
<p><b>Little Analysis or Synthesis Under Traditional
Management.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional Management analysis and
synthesis are so seldom present as to be negligible. Success or
failure are seldom if ever so studied and measured that the causes
are well understood. Therefore, no standards for future work that
are of any value can be established. It need only be added that one
reason why Traditional Management makes so little progress is
because it makes no analyses that are of permanent value. What data
it has are available for immediate use only. Practically every man
who does the work must "start at the beginning," for himself. If
this is often true of entire methods, it is even more true of
elements of methods. As elements are not studied and recorded
separately, they are not recognized when they appear again, and the
<!--Page 125--><a name="P125" id="P125"></a> resultant waste is
appalling. This waste is inevitable with the lack of
co&ouml;peration under Traditional Management and the fact that
each worker plans the greater part of his work for himself.</p>
<p><b>Analysis and Synthesis Appear Late in Transitory
Management.</b> &mdash; Division of output appears early in
Transitory Management, but it is usually not until a late stage
that motion study and time study are conducted so successfully that
scientifically determined and timed elements can be constructed
into standards. As everything that is attempted in the line of
analysis and synthesis under Transitory Management is done
scientifically under Scientific Management, we may avoid repetition
by considering Scientific Management at once.</p>
<p><b>Relation of Analysis and Synthesis in Scientific Management
to Measurement and Standardization.</b> &mdash; Analysis considers
the subject that is to be measured, &mdash; be it individual action
or output of any kind, &mdash; and divides it into such a number of
parts, and parts of such a nature, as will best suit the purpose
for which the measurement is taken. When these subdivisions have
been measured, synthesis combines them into a whole. <a href=
"#ch05fn03"><sup>3</sup></a> Under Scientific Management, through
the measurements used, synthesis is a combination of those elements
which are necessary only, and which have been proven to be most
efficient. The result of the synthesis is standardized, and used
until a more accurate standard displaces it.</p>
<p>Under Scientific Management analysis and synthesis are methods
of determining standards from <!--Page 126--><a name="P126" id=
"P126"></a> available knowledge. Measurement furnishes the
means.</p>
<p><b>Analyst's Work Is Division.</b> &mdash; It is the duty of the
analyst to divide the work that he is set to study into the
minutest divisions possible. What is possible is determined by the
time and money that can be set aside for the investigation.</p>
<p><b>The Nature of the Work Must Determine the Amount of Analysis
Practicable.</b> &mdash; In determining the amount of time and
money required, it is necessary to consider &mdash;</p>
<p>1. the cost of the work if done with no special study.</p>
<p>2. how many times the work is likely to be repeated.</p>
<p>3. how many elements that it contains are likely to be similar
to elements in work that has already been studied.</p>
<p>4. how many new elements that it contains are likely to be
available in subsequent work.</p>
<p>5. the probable cost of the work after it has been studied
&mdash;</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) the cost of doing it.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) the cost of the investigation.</p>
<p>6. The loss, if any, from delaying the work until after it has
been studied.</p>
<p>7. the availability of trained observers and measurers, analysts
and synthesists.</p>
<p>8. the available money for carrying on the investigations.</p>
<p>These questions at least must be answered before
<!--Page 127--><a name="P127" id="P127"></a> it is possible to
decide whether study shall be made or not, and to what degree it
can be carried.</p>
<p><b>Cost the Determining Factor.</b> &mdash; It is obvious that
in all observation in the industrial world cost must be the
principal determining feature. Once the cost can be estimated, and
the amount of money that can be allowed for the investigation
determined, it is possible at least to approximate satisfactory
answers to the other questions. How closely the answers approximate
depends largely on the skill and experience of the analyst.</p>
<p>The greater number of times the work is to be repeated, the less
the ultimate cost. The more elements contained similar to elements
already determined, the less the additional cost, and the less the
time necessary. The more elements contained that can be used again,
even in different work, the less the ultimate cost. The better
trained the analyst, the less the immediate or additional cost and
time.</p>
<p>Much depends on the amount of previous data at hand when the
investigation is being made, and on the skill and speed of the
analyst in using these data.</p>
<p><b>Process of Division Unending.</b> &mdash; In practice, the
process of division continues as long as it can show itself to be a
method for cost reducing. Work may be divided into processes: each
process into subdivisions; each subdivision into cycles; each cycle
into elements; each element into time units; each time unit into
motions, &mdash; and so on, indefinitely, toward the "indivisible
minimum."<a href="#ch05fn04"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<!--Page 128--><a name="P128" id="P128"></a>
<p><b>Measuring May Take Place at Any Stage.</b> &mdash; At any of
these stages of division the results may be taken as final for the
purpose of the study, &mdash; and the operations, or final
divisions of the work at that stage, may be measured.</p>
<p>To obtain results with the least expenditure of time, the
operations must be subjected to motion study before they are timed
as well as after. This motion study can be accurate and of
permanent value only in so far as the divisions are final. The
resulting improved operations are then ready to be timed.</p>
<p><b>Ultimate Analysis the Field of Psychology.</b> &mdash; When
the analyst has proceeded as far as he can in dividing the work
into prime factors the problem continues in the field of
psychology. Here the opportunities for securing further data become
almost limitless.</p>
<p><b>Ultimate Analysis Justifiable.</b> &mdash; It is the
justification for analysis to approach the ultimate as nearly as
possible, that the smaller and more difficult of measurement the
division is, the more often it will appear in various combinations
of elements. The permanence and exactness of the result vary with
the effort for obtaining it.</p>
<p><b>Qualifications of an Analyst.</b> &mdash; To be most
successful, an analyst should have ingenuity, patience, and that
love of dividing a process into its component parts and studying
each separate part that characterizes the analytic mind. The
analyst must be capable of doing accurate work, and orderly
work.</p>
<p>To get the most pleasure and profit from his work he should
realize that his great, underlying purpose <!--Page 129--><a name=
"P129" id="P129"></a> is to relieve the worker of unnecessary
fatigue, to shorten his work period per day, and to increase the
number of his days and years of higher earning power. With this
realization will come an added interest in his subject.</p>
<p><b>Worker Should Understand the Process of Analysis.</b> &mdash;
It is not enough that the worker should understand the methods of
measurement. He can get most from the resultant standards and will
most efficiently co&ouml;perate if he understands the division into
elements to be studied.</p>
<p><b>Schools Should Provide Training.</b> &mdash; Much of the
training in analysis in the schools comes at such a late period of
the course that the average industrial worker must miss a large
part of it. This is a defect in school training that should be
remedied. Even very young children soon are capable of, and greatly
enjoy, dividing a process into elements. If the worker be taught,
in his preparations, and in the work itself, to divide what he does
into its elements, he will not only enjoy analysis of his work, but
will be able to follow the analysis in his own mind, and to
co&ouml;perate better in the processes of measurement.</p>
<p><b>The Synthesist's Work Is Selection and Addition.</b> &mdash;
The synthesist studies the individual results of the analyst's
work, and their inter-relation, and determines which of these
should be combined, and in what manner, for the most economic
result. His duty is to construct that combination of the elements
which will be most efficient.</p>
<p><b>Importance of Selection Must Be Emphasized.</b> &mdash; If
synthesis in Scientific Management were nothing
<!--Page 130--><a name="P130" id="P130"></a> more than combining
all the elements that result from analysis into a whole, it would
be valuable. Any process studied analytically will be performed
more intelligently, even if there is no change in the method.</p>
<p>But the most important part of the synthesist's work is the
actual elimination of elements which are useless, and the
combination of the remaining elements in such a way, or sequence,
or schedule, that a far better method than the one analyzed will
result.</p>
<p>We may take an example from Bricklaying. <a href=
"#ch05fn05"><sup>5</sup></a> In "Stringing Mortar Method, on the
Filling Tiers before the Days of the Pack-on-the-Wall-Method"
&mdash; the division, which was into operations only, showed
eighteen operations and eighteen motions for every brick that was
laid. Study and synthesis of these elements resulted in a method
that required only 1 3/4 motions to lay a brick. Over half the
original motions were found to be useless, hence entirely omitted.
In several other cases it was found possible to make one motion do
work for two or four brick, with the same, or less, fatigue to the
worker.</p>
<p><b>Result Is the Basis for the Task.</b> &mdash; The result of
synthesis is the basis for the task, &mdash; it becomes the
standard that shows what has actually been done, and what can be
expected to be repeated. It is important to note the relation
between the task and synthesis. When it becomes generally
understood that the "Task," under Scientific Management is neither
an ideal which exists simply in the imagination, nor an
<!--Page 131--><a name="P131" id="P131"></a> impossibly high
estimate of what can be expected, &mdash; but is actually the sum
of observed and timed operations, plus a definite and sufficient
percentage of allowance for overcoming the fatigue, &mdash; then
much objection to it will cease.</p>
<p><b>General Lack of Knowledge the Chief Cause of Objection to the
Task.</b> &mdash; As is the case with most objections to Scientific
Management, or its elements, ignorance is the chief obstacle to the
introduction and success of the Task Idea. This ignorance seems to
be more or less prevalent everywhere among managers as well as
workers.</p>
<p>Scientific Management can, and does, succeed even when the
workers are ignorant of many of its fundamental principles, but it
will never make the strides that it should until every man working
under it, as well as all outside, understand <i>why</i> it is doing
as it does, as well as <i>what</i> is done.</p>
<p>This educational campaign could find no better starting point
than the word "task," and the "task idea."</p>
<p><b>The Name Task Is Unfortunate.</b> <a href=
"#ch05fn06"><sup>6</sup></a> &mdash; The Century Dictionary defines
"Task" as follows:</p>
<p>1. "a tax, an assessment, an impost</p>
<p>2. "labor imposed, especially a definite quantity or amount of
labor; work to be done; one's stint; that which duty or necessity
imposes; duty or duties collectively</p>
<p>3. "a lesson to be learned; a portion of study imposed by a
teacher <!--Page 132--><a name="P132" id="P132"></a></p>
<p>4. "work undertaken, &mdash; an undertaking</p>
<p>5. "burdensome employment; toil."</p>
<p>Only the fourth meaning, as here given, covers in any way what
is meant by the task in Scientific Management.</p>
<p>The ideas included in the other four definitions are most
unpleasant. The thought of labor; the thought that the labor is
imposed; the thought that the imposition is definite; that duty
makes it necessary that it be done; that it is burdensome; that it
is toilsome: these are most unfortunate ideas and have been
associated with the word so long in the human mind that it will be
a matter of years before a new set of associations can be formed
which will be pleasant, and which will render the word "task"
attractive and agreeable to the worker and to the public in
general.</p>
<p><b>No Other Adequate Word Has Been Suggested.</b> &mdash;
However, there seems to be no better word forthcoming; therefore,
one can but follow the example of the masters in management, who
have accepted this word, and have done their best to make it
attractive by the way they themselves have used it.</p>
<p>To the writer, the word "stint" is far more attractive and more
truly descriptive than is "task." Perhaps because of the
old-fashioned idea that a reward, usually immediate, followed the
completion of the "stint."</p>
<p>Opinions as to a preferable word will doubtless vary, but it is
self-evident that the word "task" has already become so firmly
established in Scientific Management that any attempt to change it
would result in a confusion. It is far better to concentrate
<!--Page 133--><a name="P133" id="P133"></a> on developing a new
set of associations for it in as many minds as possible.</p>
<p><b>Decided Advantage to the Use of the Word Task.</b> &mdash;
Perhaps in one way it is fortunate that the use of the word "task"
does coincide more or less with the use of that word under
Traditional Management. Under Traditional Management the task is
the work to be done. It may be just as well that the same word
should be used under Scientific Management, in order that both the
worker and investigator may realize, that, after all <i>the work
that is to be done</i> is, in its essentials, exactly the same.
With this realization from the beginning, the mind of the worker or
investigator may be the more predisposed to note the eliminations
of waste and the cutting down of time, effort and fatigue under the
scientifically derived methods.</p>
<p><b>Definition of Task as Used in Scientific Management.</b>
&mdash; The task, under Scientific Management, differs from the
task under Traditional Management in that &mdash;</p>
<p>1. The tools and surrounding conditions with which the work
shall be done are standardized.</p>
<p>2. The method in which the work shall be done is prescribed.</p>
<p>3. The time that the work shall take is scientifically
determined.</p>
<p>4. An allowance is made for rest from fatigue.</p>
<p>5. The quality of the output is prescribed.</p>
<p>When to this is added the fact that the method is taught, and
that the reward is ample, fixed, prompt and assured, the attractive
features of the task under Scientific Management have been made
plain.</p>
<!--Page 134--><a name="P134" id="P134"></a>
<p><b>Task Idea Applies to Work of Everyone.</b> &mdash; Under
Scientific Management there is a task for every member of the
organization, from the head of the management to the worker at the
most rudimentary work. This is too often not known, or not
appreciated by the worker, who feels that what is deemed best for
him should be good for everyone. The mental attitude will never be
right till all understand that the task idea will increase
efficiency when applied to any possible kind of work. With the
application of the task idea to all, will come added
co&ouml;peration.</p>
<p><b>Task Idea Applies to the Work of the Organization.</b>
&mdash; The work which is to be done by the organization should be
considered the task of the organization, and this organization task
is studied before individual tasks are set. The methods used in
determining this organization task are analysis and synthesis, just
as in the case of the individual task.</p>
<p><b>Individual Tasks Are Elements of Organization Task.</b>
&mdash; The individual tasks are considered as elements of the
organization task. The problem is, to determine the best
arrangement of these individual tasks, the best schedule, and
routing. The individual task may be thought of as something moving,
that must be gotten out of the way.</p>
<p>Management has been called largely a matter of transportation.
It may be "transportation" or moving of materials, revolution of
parts of fixed machinery, or merely transportation of parts of
one's body in manual movements; <a href=
"#ch05fn07"><sup>7</sup></a> in any case, the laws governing
transportation apply to all. This view of management
<!--Page 135--><a name="P135" id="P135"></a> is most stimulating
to the mind. A moving object attracts attention and holds interest.
Work that is interesting can be accomplished with greater speed and
less fatigue. Thinking in terms of the methods of Scientific
Management as the most accurate and efficient in transporting the
finished output and its "chips" <a href=
"#ch05fn08"><sup>8</sup></a> will be a great aid towards attaining
the best results possible by means of a new method of visualizing
the problem.</p>
<p><b>Qualifications of the Synthesist.</b> &mdash; The synthesist
must have a constructive mind, for he determines the sequence of
events as well as the method of attack. He must have the ability to
see the completed whole which he is trying to make, and to regard
the elements with which he works not only as units, but in relation
to each other. He must feel that any combination is influenced not
only by the elements that go into it, but by the inter-relation
between these elements. This differs for different combinations as
in a kaleidoscope.</p>
<p><b>The Synthesist a Conserver.</b> &mdash; The Synthesist must
never be thought of as a destructive critic. He is, in reality, a
conserver of all that is valuable in old methods. Through his work
and that of the analyst, the valuable elements of traditional
methods are incorporated into standard methods. These standard
methods will, doubtless, be improved as time goes on, but the
valuable elements will be permanently conserved.</p>
<p><b>Synthesist an Inventor.</b> &mdash; The valuable inventions
referred to as the result of measurement are the work
<!--Page 136--><a name="P136" id="P136"></a> of the synthetic
mind. It discovers new, better methods of doing work, and this
results in the invention of better means, such as tools or
equipment.</p>
<p>For example, &mdash; in the field of Bricklaying, the
Non-stooping Scaffold, the Packet and the Fountain Trowel were not
invented until the analysis of bricklaying was made, and the
synthesis of the chosen elements into standard methods made plain
the need and specifications for new equipment.</p>
<p><b>Relation of Invention to Scientific Management Important.</b>
&mdash; There has been much discussion as to the relation of
Invention to Scientific Management. It has been claimed by many
otherwise able authorities that many results claimed as due to
Scientific Management are really the results of new machinery,
tools or equipment that have been invented. <a href=
"#ch05fn09"><sup>9</sup></a> Scientific Management certainly can
lay no claim to credit for efficiency which comes through
inventions neither suggested nor determined by it. But the
inventions from the results of which Scientific Management is said
to have borrowed credit are usually, like the bricklaying
inventions cited, not only direct results of Scientific Management,
but probably would not have sprung from any other source for years
to come.</p>
<p><b>Synthesist a Discoverer of Laws.</b> &mdash; It is the
synthetic type of mind that discovers the laws. For example &mdash;
it was Dr. Taylor, with the aid of a few of his specially trained
co-workers, who discovered the following governing laws:</p>
<p>1. law of no ratio between the foot-pounds of work done and the
fatigue caused in different kinds of work. <!--Page 137--><a name=
"P137" id="P137"></a></p>
<p>2. law of percentage of rest for overcoming fatigue.</p>
<p>3. law of classification of work according to percentage of
fatigue caused.</p>
<p>4. laws for making high-speed steel.</p>
<p>5. laws relating to cutting metals.</p>
<p>6. laws that will predict the right speed, feed and cut on
metals for the greatest output.</p>
<p>7. laws for predicting maximum quantity of output that a man can
achieve and thrive.</p>
<p>8. laws for determining the selection of the men best suited for
the work.</p>
<p><b>Synthesist an Adviser on Introduction of New Methods.
&mdash;</b> Having constructed the standard tasks or standard
methods which are new, the synthesist must remember to introduce
his new task or method with as few new variables as possible. He
should so present it that all the old knowledge will come out to
meet the new, that all the brain paths that have already been made
will be utilized, and that the new path will lead out from paths
which are well known and well traveled.</p>
<p><b>Introduce with as Few New Variables as Possible. &mdash;</b>
The greatest speed in learning a new method will be attained by
introducing it with as few new variables as possible.</p>
<p>For example, &mdash; learning to dictate to a dictaphone. The
writer found it very difficult, at first, to dictate into the
dictaphone,&mdash; the whirling of the cylinder distracted the
eye, the buzzing of the motor distracted the ear, the rubber tube
leading to the mouth-piece was constantly reminding the touch that
something new was being attempted. At the suggestion
<!--Page 138--><a name="P138" id="P138"></a> of one well versed
in Scientific Management, the mouth-piece of the dictaphone was
propped on the desk telephone on a level with the mouth-piece of
the latter. The writer then found that as soon as one became
interested in the dictating and one's attention was concentrated on
the thought, one was able absolutely to forget the new variable,
because it is one which is kept constant, and to dictate fluently.
The emphasis laid on the likeness in thus dictating to the old
accustomed act of talking through the telephone, seemed to put all
other differences into the background, and to allow of forming the
new and desired habit very quickly.</p>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p><b>Effect of Analysis and Synthesis on the Work.</b> &mdash; As
the outcome of Analysis and Synthesis is Standardization, so the
effect of them upon work is standard work. Quantity of output can
be predicted, quality of output is assured.</p>
<p><b>Effect on the Worker.</b> &mdash; The effect of Analysis and
Synthesis upon the worker is to make him feel that the methods
which he is using are right, and that, because of this, his work
must be of value. The more the worker is induced to co&ouml;perate
in the determining and the combination of elements, the more will
he share with the investigators the satisfaction in getting
permanent results. The outcome of this co&ouml;peration will,
again, result in more perfect future results, and so on,
progressively.</p>

<h3>STANDARDIZATION</h3>
<p><b>Definition of Standardization.</b> &mdash; Standardization is
"the act of standardizing, or the state of being standardized." "A
standard," according to the Century Dictionary, "is that which is
set up as a unit of reference; a form, type, example, incidence, or
combination of conditions accepted as correct and perfect and hence
as a basis of comparison. A criterion established by custom, public
opinion or general consent; a model." <a href=
"#ch06fn01"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>We must note particularly that the standard is a "unit of
reference," that it is a "basis of comparison," and that it is "a
model." These three phrases describe the standard in management,
and are particularly emphasized by the use of the standard in
Scientific Management.</p>
<p><b>Standards Derived from Actual Practice.</b> &mdash;
Management derives its standards not from theories as to best
methods, but from scientific study of actual practice. <a href=
"#ch06fn02"><sup>2</sup></a> As already shown, the method of
deriving a standard is &mdash;</p>
<!--Page 140--><a name="P140" id="P140"></a>
<p>1. to analyze the best practice known into the smallest possible
elements,</p>
<p>2. to measure these elements,</p>
<p>3. to adopt the least wasteful elements as standard
elements,</p>
<p>4. to synthesize the necessary standard elements into the
standard.</p>
<p><b>The Standard Is Progressive.</b> &mdash; A standard remains
fixed only until a more perfect standard displaces it. The data
from which the standard was derived may be reviewed because of some
error, because a further subdivision of the elements studied may
prove possible, or because improvements in some factor of the work,
i.e., the worker, material, tools, equipment, etc., may make a new
standard desirable.</p>
<p>The fact that a standard is recognized as not being an ultimate
standard in no wise detracts from its working value. As Captain
Metcalfe has said: "Whatever be the standard of measurement, it
suffices for comparison if it be generally accepted, if it be
impartially applied, and if the results be fully recorded."
<a href="#ch06fn03"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Change in the Standard Demands Change in the Task and in the
Incentive.</b> &mdash; Necessarily, with the change in the standard
comes a change in the task and in the reward. All parts of
Scientific Management are so closely related that it is impossible
to make a successful progressive step in one branch without
simultaneously making all the related progressions in other
branches that go with it.</p>
<p>For example, &mdash; if the material upon which a standard
<!--Page 141--><a name="P141" id="P141"></a> was based caused
more care or effort, a smaller task must be set, and wages must be
proportionately lowered. <i>Proportionately</i>, note, for
determining that change would necessitate a review and a
redistribution of the cost involved.</p>
<p>In the same way, if an improvement in equipment necessitated a
new method, as does the packet in laying brick, a new task would
become imperative, and a reconsideration of the wage. The wage
might remain the same, it might go down, it might go up. In actual
practice, in the case of bricklayers, it has gone up. But the point
is, it <i>must</i> be restudied. This provides effectually against
cutting the rate or increasing the task in any unjust manner.</p>
<p><b>Similarity Between the Standard and the "Judgment" of
Psychology.</b> &mdash; There are many points of similarity between
the "Standard," of management, and the "judgment" of psychology.
Sully says, in speaking of the judgment, <a href=
"#ch06fn04"><sup>4</sup></a> &mdash; "This process of judging
illustrates the two fundamental elements in thought activity, viz.,
analysis and synthesis." "To judge is clearly to discern and to
mark off as a special object of thought some connecting relation."
"To begin with, before we can judge we must have the requisite
materials for forming a judgment." "In the second place, to judge
is to carry out a process of reflection on given material." "In
addition to clearness and accuracy, our judgments may have other
perfections. So far as our statements accord with known facts, they
should be adhered to, &mdash; at least, till new evidence proves
them untrue."</p>
<!--Page 142--><a name="P142" id="P142"></a>
<p><b>Psychology a Final Appeal as to Permanent Value of Any
Standard.</b> &mdash; The standard under management, even under
Scientific Management, can lay no claim to being perfect. It can
never nearly approach perfection until the elements are so small
that it is practicable to test them psychologically and
physiologically. The time when this can be done in many lines, when
the benefit that will directly accrue will justify the necessary
expenditure, may seem far distant, but every analysis of
operations, no matter how rudimentary, is hastening the day when
the underlying, permanently valuable elements can be determined and
their variations studied.</p>
<p><b>Co&ouml;peration Will Hasten the Day of Psychological and
Physiological Study of Standards.</b> &mdash; Co&ouml;peration in
collecting and comparing the results of motion study and time study
everywhere will do much to assist toward more ultimate
determination of elements. At the present time the problems that
management submits to psychology are too indefinite and cover too
large a field to be attacked successfully. Co&ouml;peration between
management standardizers would mean &mdash;</p>
<p>1. that all management data would be available to psychologists
and physiologists.</p>
<p>2. that such data, being available also to all standardizers,
would prevent reduplication of results.</p>
<p>3. that savings would result.</p>
<p>4. that, from a study and comparison of the collected data a
trained synthetic mind could build up better standards than could
be built from any set of individual data. <!--Page 143--><a name=
"P143" id="P143"></a></p>
<p>5. Savings would result from this.</p>
<p>6. Inventions would also result.</p>
<p>7. Savings would again result from these.</p>
<p>8. All of these various savings could be invested in more
intensive study of elements.</p>
<p>9. These more valuable results would again be available to
psychologists and physiologists.</p>
<p>This cycle would go on indefinitely. Meantime, all would benefit
with little added cost to any. For the results of the psychological
and physiological study would be available to all, and
investigators in those lines have shown themselves ready and glad
to undertake investigations.</p>
<p><b>Purpose of Standardization.</b> &mdash; The purpose of
standardizing is the same under all types of management; that is,
it is the elimination of waste.</p>
<p><b>Standardization Frequently Attempted Under Traditional
Management.</b> &mdash; In much progressive Traditional Management
there is an appreciation of the necessity of standardizing tools
and equipment, that is to say, of having these on the "duplicate
part system," that assembling may be done quickly, and repairs made
without delay.</p>
<p>The manager notices some particularly successful man, or method,
or arrangement of tools, equipment, or the surroundings, and
decides to have a record made thereof that the success may be
repeated. These records, if made in sufficient detail, are very
valuable. The difficulty is that so often the man making the
records does not observe all the variables. Hence the very elements
which caused the success may be overlooked entirely.</p>
<!--Page 144--><a name="P144" id="P144"></a>
<p><b>Value of Standardization Not Appreciated Under Traditional
Management.</b> &mdash; It is surprising, under Traditional
Management, to note, in many cases, the years that elapse before
any need for standardization is felt. It is also surprising that,
even when some standardization has been done, its importance is
seldom realized. The new standard becomes a matter of course, and
the management fails to be impressed enough with its benefits to
apply the principle of standardization to other fields.</p>
<p><b>Under Transitory Management Standardization Becomes
Constantly More Important.</b> &mdash; Not until Motion Study and
Time Study have been introduced can the full benefits of
standardization be attained. But as soon as the Transitory Stage of
Management appears, the importance of standardization is realized.
This is brought about largely through the records of individual
outputs, which constantly call attention to the necessity of making
available to all the methods, tools and equipment of the most
successful workers.</p>
<p><b>Records of Successes Become More Profitable.</b> &mdash; The
rules which embody successful practice become more profitable as
the necessity for more detailed recording of all the variables
becomes possible. An appreciation of what scientific motion study
and time study will ultimately do affects the minds of the
management until the workers are given directions as to methods to
be used, and the incentive of extra pay for following
directions.</p>
<p><b>"Systems" Show an Appreciation of Psychology.</b> &mdash; The
"Systems," standing orders or collections <!--Page 145--><a name=
"P145" id="P145"></a> of written directions, that are evolved at
this stage have a permanent value. This is especially true when the
directions, often called "rules," contain the reason for the rule.
There is a decided awakening to the importance of Psychology in
this appeal to the reason of the worker. He is not affronted by
being forced to follow directions for which he is given no reason
and which he has no reason to believe have been scientifically
derived. These rules, in a certain typical case, are stated in
simple language, some in the form of commands, some in the form of
suggestions, and are obviously so prepared as to be understood and
obeyed by the workers with the least possible amount of effort,
opposition and time. As ample opportunity is given for suggestions,
the worker's attention and interest are held, and any craving he
may have for self-expression is gratified.</p>
<p><b>Systems Permanently Useful.</b> &mdash; These systems,
collections of rules, directions or standing orders are useful even
when Ultimate Management is completely installed &mdash;</p>
<p>1. for use as records of successful methods which may be
scientifically studied for elements.</p>
<p>2. for use by the instruction card clerk in explaining to the
men why the rules on the instruction card are given.</p>
<p><b>Relation of Systems to Standards Should Be Emphasized.</b>
&mdash; The worker is too often not made to understand the relation
of Systems to Standards. The average worker does not object to
Systems, because he realizes that the System is a collection of his
best, least wasteful methods of doing work. <!--Page 146--><a name=
"P146" id="P146"></a> When he can be convinced that standards
are only efficient elements of his own methods scientifically
studied and combined, any opposition to them will disappear.</p>
<p><b>The Personal Note of the "System" Should Be Preserved.</b>
&mdash; Perhaps one thing that makes the typical "Systems" so
attractive is the personal note that they contain. Illustrated with
pictures of successful work that the workers themselves have done,
often containing pictures of the men themselves that illustrate
successful methods, with mention of the names of men who have
offered valuable suggestions or inventions, they make the worker
feel his part in successful results. They conserve the old spirit
of co&ouml;peration between the master and his apprentices.</p>
<p>The conditions of modern industry make it extremely difficult to
conserve this feeling. Scientific Management is successful not only
because it makes possible a more effective co&ouml;peration than
has ever existed since the old "master-and-apprentice" relation
died out, but also because it conserves in the Systems the interim
channel for personal communication between the various members of
the organization.</p>
<p><b>Systems a Valuable Assistance in Transition to Scientific
Management.</b> &mdash; One great problem which those introducing
Scientific Management have to face is exactly how to make the
worker understand the relation of the new type of management to the
old. The usefulness of the written system in use in most places
where it is planned to introduce Scientific Management as a means
of making the worker <!--Page 147--><a name="P147" id=
"P147"></a> understand the transition has, perhaps, not been
appreciated.</p>
<p>The development of the standard from the system is easy to
explain. This being done, all parts of Scientific Management are so
closely related that their interrelation can be readily made
apparent.</p>
<p>It is the worker's right as well as privilege to understand the
management under which he works, and he only truly co&ouml;perates,
with his will and judgment as well as with his hands, when he feels
that his mind is a part of the directing mind.</p>
<p><b>Standardization Under Scientific Management Eliminates Waste
Scientifically.</b> &mdash; Under Scientific Management the
elimination of waste by the use of standards becomes a science.
Standards are no longer based on opinions, as under Traditional
Management, but are based upon scientific investigation of the
elements of experience.</p>
<p>As James says, in the "Psychology, Briefer Course," page 156,
paragraph 4, &mdash; "It is obvious and palpable that our state of
mind is never precisely the same. Every thought we have of a given
fact is, strictly speaking, unique and only bears a resemblance of
kind with our other thoughts of the same facts. When the identical
fact recurs we must think of it in a fresh manner, see it under a
somewhat different angle, apprehend it in different relations from
those in which it last appeared."</p>
<p><b>The Standard the Result of Measurement.</b> &mdash; It is
obvious, therefore, that a scientifically derived standard can
never be the outcome of an opinion. Whenever the opinion returns,
the different thoughts <!--Page 148--><a name="P148" id=
"P148"></a> with which it would be accompanied would so color it
as to change it, and the standard with it. It is obvious,
therefore, that a standard must be the result of definite
mathematical and other measured proof, and not of an opinion, and
that the standard must be in such physical shape that the
subject-matter will always be clearly defined, otherwise the
ultimate losses resulting from dependent sequences of the standard
schedule and time-tables would be enormous.</p>
<p><b>Successful Standardization Demands Complete Conformity to
Standards.</b> &mdash; The laws for establishment of standards; the
laws of achieving them; the laws for preventing deviations from
those paths that will permit of their achievement; the dependent
sequences absolutely necessary to perform the complete whole; these
have been worked out and given to the world by Dr. Taylor, who
recognized, as James has said, page 157, that, "a permanently
existing 'Idea' which makes its appearance before the footlights of
consciousness at periodic intervals, is as mythological an entity
as the Jack of Spades." The entire organization from the highest to
the lowest must conform to these standards. It is out of the
question to permit the deviations resulting from individual
initiative. Individual initiative is quite as objectionable in
obtaining the best results, &mdash; that is, high wages and low
production cost, &mdash; as service would be on a railroad if each
locomotive engineer were his own train despatcher, determining at
what time and to what place he would go.</p>
<p><b>Initiative Provided For.</b> &mdash; There is a distinct
place <!--Page 149--><a name="P149" id="P149"></a> for
initiative in Scientific Management, but that place is not outside
of the planning department, until the planning department's method
has been proved to be fully understood by achieving it. The
standards must be made by the men to whom this work is assigned,
and they must be followed absolutely by the worker. He is willing
to follow them, under Scientific Management, because he realizes
that a place for his suggestions is supplied, and that, if his
suggestions are accepted, they will be incorporated into the new
standards which must then be followed by all thereafter.</p>
<p><b>Standardization Applies to the Work of All.</b> &mdash; It is
important to note that standardizing is applied to the work of all.
This, if understood by all, will do away with all question of
discrimination or the lack of a "square deal." It will make the
worker feel ready to follow his standard exactly, just as he knows
the manager is following his. So, also, the worker should be made
to realize that the very fact that there is a standardization
means, under Scientific Management, that that applies to every man,
and that there is no discrimination against him in any possible
way.</p>
<p><b>Standardization Conserves and Develops Individuality.</b>
&mdash; Standardization conserves individual capacity by doing away
with the wasteful process of trial and error of the individual
workman. It develops individuality by allowing the worker to
concentrate his initiative upon work that has not before been done,
and by providing incentive and reward for inventions.</p>
<!--Page 150--><a name="P150" id="P150"></a>
<p><b>Waste Eliminated Is Eliminated Permanently.</b> &mdash;
Scientific Management not only eliminates waste, but provides that
waste shall be eliminated for all time in the future.</p>
<p>The standard once written down, there can be no slipping back
into the old methods based upon opinions of the facts.</p>
<p><b>Standardization Under Scientific Management Resembles
Standardization of Spelling.</b> &mdash; The need for
standardization has already been emphasized, but might further be
illustrated by the discussions, pro and con, of the question of
simplified spelling. Before the days of dictionaries, our spelling
was not standardized &mdash; it was the privilege of any good
writer to spell much as he desired; but the creation of written
standards of spelling, that is to say the making of dictionaries,
fixed the forms of spelling at that time, that is, created
standards. The Simplified Spelling Board is now endeavoring to make
some new standards, their action being based upon sufficient
reasons for making a change, and also for not changing the spelling
of any word until it is determined that the suggested spelling is
more advisable than the old spelling.</p>
<p>Just so, under Scientific Management, the best known standards
are used continuously until better have been discovered. The
planning department, consisting of the best men available, whose
special duty it is to create new standards, acts as does the
Simplified Spelling Board, as a court of appeals for new standards,
which must pass this court before they can hope to succeed the old,
and which must, <!--Page 151--><a name="P151" id="P151"></a> if
they are to be accepted, possess many elements of the old and be
changed only in such a way that the users can, without difficulty,
shift to the new use.</p>
<p><b>Under Scientific Management Nomenclature Is Standardized.</b>
&mdash; Under Standardization in Scientific Management the
standardization of the nomenclature, of the names and of the terms
used must be noted. The effect of this upon the mind is excellent,
because the use of a word very soon becomes a habit &mdash; its
associations become fixed. If different names are used for the same
thing, &mdash; that is to say, if different names are used
indiscriminately, the thing itself becomes hazy, in just such a
degree as it possesses many names. The use of the fixed term, the
fixed word, leads to definiteness always. Just so, also, the
Mnemonic Symbol system in use by Scientific Management, leads to
swift identification of the subdivision of the classification to
which it is applied, and to elimination of waste in finding and
remembering where to find any particular thing or piece of
information desired. By it may be identified "the various articles
of manufacture and papers relating to it as well as the operations
to be performed on each piece and the various charges of the
establishment."</p>
<p><b>Mnemonic Symbols Save Time and Effort.</b> &mdash; These
Mnemonic Symbols save actual motions and time in speaking and
writing, and save time in that they are so designed as to be
readily remembered. They also save time and effort in that the mind
accustomed to them works with them as collective groups of
<!--Page 152--><a name="P152" id="P152"></a> ideas, without
stopping to elaborate them into their more detailed form.</p>
<p><b>Standard Phraseology Eliminates Waste.</b> &mdash; As typical
of the savings effected by standardization, we may cite a lineman
talking to the Central Telephone Office: &mdash;</p>
<p>"John Doe &mdash; 1234 L. Placing Extension Station," This
signified &mdash; "My name is John Doe, I am telephoning from
number 1234, party L. I have finished installing an extension
station. Where shall I go next?"</p>
<p>In the same way standard signals are remembered best by the man
who signals and are understood quickest by the man who receives
them, with a direct increase in speed to the work done.</p>
<p><b>Standard Man Is the Man upon Whom Studies Are Made.</b>
&mdash; The standard man is the ideal man to observe and with whom
to obtain the best Motion Study and Time Study data. He is the
fastest worker, working under the direction of the man best
informed in the particular trade as to the motions of best present
practice, and being timed by a Time Study Expert.</p>
<p><b>Relation Between the Standard Man, the First-Class Man, the
Given Man and the Task.</b> &mdash; The "first-class man" under
Scientific Management means the man who is best fitted by nature
and by training to do the task permanently or until promoted.</p>
<p>The "given man" is the man who is actually put to work at the
task, whether or not he is well fitted for its performance.</p>
<p>The "task" is that percentage of the standard
<!--Page 153--><a name="P153" id="P153"></a> man's achievement
that the given man to whom the task is to be assigned can do
continuously and thrive, that he can do easily enough to win his
bonus without injuring himself, temporarily or permanently, in any
way.</p>
<p><b>Writing the Standard Means for Conveying Information.</b>
&mdash; Under Scientific Management, and even in the early stages
of Transitory Management, writing is the standard means of
conveying information.</p>
<p>All orders, without exception, should be in writing. This
insures that the "eye workers" get their directions in the most
impressive form; does away with the need of constant oral
repetition; eliminates confusion; insures a clear impression in the
mind of the giver as well as of the receiver of the order as to
exactly what is wanted; and provides a record of all orders given.
Putting the instructions in writing in no way precludes utilizing
the worker's natural aptitude to learn by imitation, for he also
always has the opportunity to watch and imitate the workings of the
functional teachers as well as his scientifically taught
fellow-workers.</p>
<p><b>The Instruction Card the Standard Method of Conveying
Instructions as to the Task.</b> &mdash; The records of the work of
the standard man are contained in data of the Motion Study and Time
Study department. These records, in the form in which they are to
be used by the man who is to perform the task, are, for the benefit
of that man, incorporated in what is known as the instruction
card.</p>
<p><b>Definition of the Instruction Card.</b> &mdash; The
instruction card is a set of directions for the man, telling
<!--Page 154--><a name="P154" id="P154"></a> him what he is to
do, how he is to do it, how long it should take him to do it, and
what he will receive for doing it, and giving him an opportunity to
call for, and obtain, assistance the instant that he finds he
cannot do it, and to report back to the managers as to how he has
succeeded in the performance.</p>
<p>The Instruction Card has been called "a self-producer of a
predetermined product."</p>
<p><b>Comparative Definition of Instruction Cards, Under Scientific
Management.</b> &mdash; There are three types of Instruction Cards,
which may be described as follows:</p>
<p>Type One: &mdash; Largely geographical, telling</p>
<p>1. Where to Work.</p>
<p>2. From Whom to Take Orders.</p>
<p>3. What to Do.</p>
<p>Type Two: &mdash; Typical engineer's specification, &mdash;
telling</p>
<p>1. Results desired.</p>
<p>2. Qualities of Products.</p>
<p>Type Three: &mdash; A list of elementary, step-by-step
instructions, subdivided into their motions, with time allowed for
each timable element, preferably for each motion, and a division
between</p>
<p>1. Getting ready.</p>
<p>2. Making or constructing.</p>
<p>3. Clearing up. This is the only type used by Scientific
Management.</p>
<p><b>Directions, Pay Allowance and Time Allowance Essential.</b>
&mdash; The Instruction Card under Scientific Management must
contain directions, and state the pay allowance and time
allowance.</p>
<!--Page 155--><a name="P155" id="P155"></a>
<p>Directions as to how the work shall be done eliminate waste by
cutting out all wrong methods and prescribing the right method
exactly.</p>
<p>The setting of a time in which the work is to be done is a great
stimulus to the worker, and is also necessary, because upon the
attainment of this set time depends the ability of the managers to
pay the bonus to the worker, and also to maintain a schedule, or
time-table, that will make possible the maintaining of necessary
conditions for others, in turn, to earn their bonuses. It cannot be
too often emphasized that the extra wages are paid to the men out
of the savings, and are absolutely dependent upon the fact of there
being savings. It is only when the worker does the work within the
time prescribed, that the managers do save enough to warrant the
payment of the extra wages that compensate the man for doing the
stipulated quantity of work.</p>
<p>The instruction card contains a statement of the wage or bonus
that will be earned for the complete performance of the task set
therein, thus furnishing an incentive at the time that the work is
done.</p>
<p><b>Standard Division of Instruction Card Necessary.</b> &mdash;
There are many reasons for dividing an instruction card in the
present standard way, namely, &mdash;</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) to reduce the amount of time study
observation necessary to be taken,</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) to reduce the difficulties of synthesizing
the time studied element,</p>
<p class="ltritem">(c) to locate quickly just where the worker
needs help and instruction to enable him to achieve his task,
<!--Page 156--><a name="P156" id="P156"></a></p>
<p class="ltritem">(d) to keep up the interest of the worker by
having short time elements with which to measure his relative
ability,</p>
<p class="ltritem">(e) to present the subject-matter of instruction
in such natural subdivisions that resting places are automatically
provided that allow the mind to recover from its absorption of each
subdivision. This provides definite stopping places between
co-related units of instruction holding the attention as a complete
unit against distraction, and a complete resting place between
subdivisions that permits the mind to relax and wander without
losing complete grasp of each unit as a whole.</p>
<p><b>Detailed Instruction Educative.</b> &mdash; The greater the
perfection of the detail of the instruction card, the greater the
educative value of this plan of management. The educative value of
the instruction card will be discussed at length under
Teaching.</p>
<p>Those inexperienced in Scientific Management have complained
that the detail of Instruction Cards and other parts of Scientific
Management is tiresome. Dr. Taylor has answered such objectors in
Discussions, and also in his own directions for planning the
Instruction Card, which are to be found in "Shop Management."</p>
<p>The advantages of the detailed instruction card are more than
might appear on the surface. Not only does the man whose attention
is easily distracted keep to his work better if he is told every
possible detail, but also the cards when filed can be taken out
<!--Page 157--><a name="P157" id="P157"></a> again, and every
detail and item of the method reviewed at length and revised if
necessary.</p>
<p>The experienced worker who gets to know the instruction by rote
is not bothered by extreme detail. On the contrary, he grasps it at
a glance, and focuses his mind upon any new feature and upon the
speed and exactness of muscular action needed for compliance with
the card.</p>
<p><b>Language of Instruction Card Important.</b> &mdash; The
language in which instructions and commands are transmitted on the
instruction card is of sufficient importance to warrant careful
consideration. It would be helpful if the instruction card clerk
and the man who is to use the instruction cards were both masters
of English, but this is hardly to be expected. The best substitute
for such special English training is a "System" for the use of the
instruction card clerk that will give him some outline of English
that will by degrees make his wording terse, simple and
unambiguous.</p>
<p>He should be impressed with the value of short sentences, and of
sentences that will require no punctuation other than a period at
the end. The short sentence is the most important step toward
brevity, terseness, conciseness and clear thinking.</p>
<p>The second most important feature is that the instruction card
clerk always uses the same standard wording for the same
instructions. Repetition of phrasing is a virtue, and the use of
the same word for the same thing and the same meaning repeatedly is
very desirable. The wording, phrasing and sentencing should be
standard wherever possible.</p>
<!--Page 158--><a name="P158" id="P158"></a>
<p><b>Standard Phrasing Desirable.</b> &mdash; After a short time a
phrase or sentence that is often repeated will be recognized as
quickly as will a word or a letter. Men who cannot read and write
at all are comparatively few. Men who can read and write but little
are many. It is entirely possible to teach such men standard
groupings, which they can recognize on the Instruction Card and use
in a very short time.</p>
<p>For example, &mdash; laborers who do not even know their
alphabets will learn quickly to read setting marks on cut
stone.</p>
<p>Just as mnemonic symbols save time and effort, so standard
phrasing aids toward finding out what is to be done, and
remembering how it is to be done. <a href=
"#ch06fn05"><sup>5</sup></a> Both of these can be accomplished if
the standardization is so complete that directions can be read and
remembered almost at a glance. <a href=
"#ch06fn06"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Specific Terms Helpful.</b> &mdash; To be most effective,
directions should be in the imperative form, and in specific
terms.</p>
<p>The history and growth of language shows that the language of
the savage consisted of vague general terms as compared to the
specific individual terms of the modern language of civilized man.
There are examples to be seen on every hand to-day where the oral
language of instructions and orders to proceed, that are given to
the worker, are still more vague, comparatively, than the language
between savages.</p>
<!--Page 159--><a name="P159" id="P159"></a>
<p><b>Similarity of Form and Shape Advisable.</b> &mdash; As for
the form and shape, as Dr. Taylor says, "anything that will
transmit ideas by sketch or wording will serve as an instruction
card." He advises, however, taking advantage of the saving in time
to be gained by having the instruction cards as nearly alike as
possible. They may, for convenience' sake, vary as to length, but
in width, ruling, spacing and wording they should be as nearly
alike as possible.</p>
<p><b>Standard Surroundings Valuable.</b> &mdash; Standard
environment, or surroundings, of the worker are valuable for two
reasons:</p>
<p>1. Because they directly increase output by eliminating
everything which might distract attention or cause needless
fatigue, and by assisting in the attainment of more output by
having the best possible surroundings for greater output.</p>
<p>2. Because all surroundings suggest an easy achievement. Knowing
that everything has been done to make his work possible and easy,
the worker feels this atmosphere of possibility and ease around
him, and the suggestive power of this is strong.</p>
<p><b>Unnecessary Fatigue Should Be Eliminated.</b> &mdash; The
walls, appliances and furniture, and the clothing of the worker
should be of that color which will rest his eyes from the fatigue
of the work. All unnecessary noise should be eliminated, and
provision should be made, where possible, that the workers may
enjoy their sleep or their rest hours in perfect quiet.</p>
<p>Records show the value of having quiet reign in and near the
camp, that the workers may not be disturbed. Even though they are
not disturbed <!--Page 160--><a name="P160" id="P160"></a>
enough to be waked up, every noise that is registered in the brain
affects the body, for it is now conceded that the body reflects
every phase of mental activity.</p>
<p><b>All Mental States Affect Bodily States</b> &mdash; Dr.
Stratton says: "It is now generally accepted that the body reflects
every shade of psychic operations; that in all manner of mental
action there is some physical expression." <a href=
"#ch06fn07"><sup>7</sup></a> All consciousness is motor "is the
brief expression of this important truth; every mental state
somehow runs over into a corresponding bodily state."</p>
<p><b>Elimination of Worry Assists in Concentrating Attention.</b>
&mdash; The more fireproof the building, and the more stable the
other conditions, the greater the efficiency of the inmate.
Burglar-proof buildings not only actually induce better sleep, in
that possible intrusions are eliminated, but give a state of mental
peace by the removal of apprehension. So also, a "germ proof" house
is not only really more healthful for an inmate, but eliminates
worry over possible danger of ill health. The mental health of the
worker not only controls, in a measure, his physical health, but
also his desire to work. Having no distractions, he can put his
mind upon that which is given him to do.</p>
<p><b>Distracted Attention Causes Fatigue.</b> &mdash; The
attention of the worker is apt to be distracted not only by
recognized dangers, such as burglars, fires, and disease, but also
by other transitory things that, involuntarily on his part, take
his mind from the work in hand. A flickering light distracts the
attention <!--Page 161--><a name="P161" id="P161"></a> and
causes fatigue, whether we have consciously noticed it or not. Many
things are recorded by the senses without one's being conscious of
them.</p>
<p>For example, the ceasing of a clock to tick, although we have
not noticed that it was ticking. Another example is the effect upon
the pulse or the brain of being spoken to when asleep.</p>
<p>The flickering lamp of the chronocyclegraph device is much more
fatiguing than the steady lamp of plain cyclegraphs.</p>
<p><b>Proper Placing of Workers Eliminates Distracted
Attention.</b> &mdash; Workers must be placed so that they do not
see intermittently moving objects out of the corners of their eyes.
In the early history of man it was continuously necessary to watch
for first evidence of things behind one, or at a distance, in order
to be safe from an enemy. From generations of survival of the most
fit there have developed human eyes most sensitive to moving
objects that are seen out of the corner of the eye. Even civilized
man has his attention distracted quickest, and most, by those
moving objects that he sees the least distinctly, and furthest to
one side from the direction in which he is looking.</p>
<p>The leaf that moves or the grass that trembles may attract the
attention where seen "out of the corner of the eye" to a point
where it will even cause a start and a great fear.</p>
<p>As an example of the distracting effect of moving objects seen
"out of the corner of the eye," try reading a book facing a window
in a car where the moving scenery can be seen on each side of the
book. <!--Page 162--><a name="P162" id="P162"></a> The flitting
object will interrupt one, one cannot get the full meaning out of
what one is reading &mdash; yet if one lays down the book and looks
directly at the scenery, the mind can concentrate to a point where
one does not see that moving scenery which is directly in front of
the eyes.</p>
<p>There is a great difference in this power of sensitiveness of
the corners of some workers' eyes from that of others. The first
move of Scientific Management is to place and arrange all workers,
as far as is possible, in such a position that nothing to distract
them will be behind them, and later to see that the eyes of workers
are tested, that those whose eyes are most sensitive may be placed
accordingly.</p>
<p><b>This Elimination May Take Place in All Kinds of Work.</b>
&mdash; The necessity of removing all things which will distract
the attention is as great for the brain worker as for the shop or
construction worker. All papers that attract the eye, and hence the
attention, should be cleaned from the desk, everything except that
on which the worker is working. The capability of being distracted
by the presence of other things varies in all workers.</p>
<p>In using the dictaphone, one can do much better work if one is
in a room where there is little or nothing to distract attention.
An outline of work ahead, may tempt to study and planning of what
is ahead, rather than to carrying out the task scheduled for
immediate performance. The presence of a paper with an outline
merely of what is being done is found to be a great help, as the
eye can rest on that, and after a few moments, will become so
accustomed to <!--Page 163--><a name="P163" id="P163"></a> it
that the whole attention will be given to the dictating.</p>
<p><b>Benefits of Eliminating "Decision of Choice."</b> &mdash;
There is always time lost by "decision of choice." The elimination
of this is well illustrated by the bricks that are piled on the
packet, which decides for the bricklayer which brick is next,
making an obvious sequence, hence the saving of time of decision
regarding motions, also the saving coming from the play for
position. Oftentimes a handicap of slow mental action can be
compensated for, in a measure, by planning ahead in great detail.
In this way, if the plan is made sufficiently in detail, there is
absolutely no time possible left to be wasted in "decision of
choice." The worker goes from one step to another, and as these
steps are arranged logically, his mind does not tend to wander
away, but to keep on in an uninterrupted sequence to the goal.</p>
<p><b>Standard Equipment Important.</b> &mdash; As for equipment,
the phenomena of habit are among the most important features of the
psychology of management and the possibilities of the elimination
of unnecessary waste resulting from taking advantage of this
feature is possible only when the equipment, surroundings and
methods of the worker are standardized. Therefore the insistence
upon standardization, even down to the smallest things, is vital
for achieving the greatest output.</p>
<p>For example, &mdash; suppose the keys of the monotype machine,
piano or typewriter were not located permanently in the same
relative position. Consider the loss of time in not being able to
use habits in finding <!--Page 164--><a name="P164" id=
"P164"></a> each key. Such an arrangement sounds ridiculous on
the face of it, yet it is a common practice for many operators,
especially of monotype machines, to make a complete mental decision
as to the muscles and fingers with which they will strike the
desired key.</p>
<p>Imagine the records of output of a typist who was using a
different keyboard every day, if there were that many kinds of
keyboards. It is easy for anyone to conceive the great advantages
of standard keyboards for such machines, but only those who have
made a study of output of all kinds of workers can fully realize
that similar differences in sizes of output are being produced by
the workers of the country for lack of similar standardization of
working conditions and equipment.</p>
<p><b>Utmost Standardization Does Not Make "Machines" of the
Workers Operating Under It.</b> &mdash; The attention of those who
believe that standardization makes machines out of the workers
themselves, is called to the absence of such effect upon the typist
as compared with the scribe, the monotype and linotype operator as
compared with the compositor, and the mechanical computing machine
operator as compared with the arithmetician.</p>
<p><b>Standard Methods Demand Standard Tools and Devices.</b>
&mdash; Habits cannot be standardized until the devices and tools
used are of standard pattern. It is not nearly so essential to have
the best tools as it is to have standard tools. <a href=
"#ch06fn08"><sup>8</sup></a> Experience in the hospitals
<!--Page 165--><a name="P165" id="P165"></a> points to the
importance of this fact in surgery. Tools once adopted as standard
should not be changed until the improvement or greater efficiency
from their use will compensate for the loss during the period of
"breaking in" the user, that is, of forming new habits in order to
handle strange tools. As will be brought out more fully under
"Teaching," good habits are as difficult to break as bad ones, the
only difference being that one does not usually desire to break
good ones. Naturally, if a new device is introduced, what was an
excellent habit for the old device becomes, perhaps, a very bad
habit for the new device. There must come a time before the
manipulation of the new device has become a habit when output will
go down and costs will go up. It is necessary, before introducing
this device, to investigate whether the ultimate reduction of costs
will be sufficient to allow for this period of lower production. It
is not fair, however, to the new device or method really to
consider its record until the use of it has become such a habit
with the workers as was the use of the old device.</p>
<p>No one who has not made a study of cutting tools can realize the
crying need for standardizing in that field. Dr. Taylor says,
writing in the Revised "Shop Management" of 1911, &mdash; "Hardly a
shop can be found in which tools made from a dozen different
qualities of steel are not used side by side, in many cases with
little or no means of telling one make from another." <a href=
"#ch06fn09"><sup>9</sup></a> The effect of the slightest variation
in the shape or the method of handling the tool
<!--Page 166--><a name="P166" id="P166"></a> upon the three
dimensions of the work that the tool can do in a given time, is
astounding. <a href="#ch06fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> More important,
from the psychological point of view, is the effect upon the mind
of the worker of seeing such unstandardized equipment; of having to
stop to select the particular tool that he desires, and thus having
his attention distracted from his work; and of knowing that his act
of judgment in so selecting is of no permanent value, as the next
time he needs a similar tool he will probably have to reselect.</p>
<p><b>Standard Clothing a Crying Need.</b> &mdash; There is a great
need today for standardization in the field of clothing. The idea
prevalent that wearing apparel is attractive only when it is
"different" is unfortunate in its influence upon the cost of
living. How much more unfortunate is it, when it affects the mind
of the worker, and leads him to look upon standard working clothes
with distaste.</p>
<p>To a careful observer, there is nothing more disheartening than
a study of workers' clothes, especially the clothes of women
workers. Too warm clothes where work requiring high temperature is
done, with no provision for adding needed wraps for the trip home;
high-heeled shoes where the worker must stand at her task for hours
at a time; tight waists and ill fitting skirts, where every muscle
should have free play, &mdash; these are but examples of hundreds
of places where reforms are needed.</p>
<p>Little or no blame attaches to the worker for this state of
affairs. Seldom, if ever, does the management
<!--Page 167--><a name="P167" id="P167"></a> attempt to
standardize working clothes. Moreover, the underlying idea is not
made clear that such clothes bear no resemblance to the meaningless
uniforms which are badge and symbol of service. They resemble
rather the blouse or pinafore of the artist, the outfit of the
submarine diver or the fireman.</p>
<p><b>The Sports Present a Fine Example of This.</b> &mdash; The
greatest advance toward standardizing clothing has come in the
sports, which, in many respects, present admirable object-lessons.
In the tennis court, on the links, on the gridiron, the diamond, or
track, the garment worn of itself does not increase fatigue. On the
contrary, it is so designed as not to interfere with the efficiency
of the wearer.</p>
<p><b>Management Should Provide Clothing Standards.</b> &mdash;
Under Ultimate Management the most efficient clothing for any kind
of work will be standardized. The expense of such articles of
clothing as will add to the quantity or quality of output will,
directly or indirectly, be borne by the management, just as it now
bears the expense for equipment and tools. These essentials being
supplied, and the underlying dignity and importance of
standardization understood, the worker will gladly conform, and
supply the minor accessories.</p>
<p><b>Such Standards Must Apply to All.</b> &mdash; It is of the
utmost importance that such standardization, when adopted, should
apply to the clothing of all, managers as well as employ&eacute;s.
When the old pride in the "crafts" returns, or when efficiency is
as universal in the industrial world as it is in the world of
sport, &mdash; then one may look for results.</p>
<!--Page 168--><a name="P168" id="P168"></a>
<p><b>Effects of Such Standards Enormous.</b> &mdash; The effect
which such standardized clothing would have on the physical and
mental well-being of the wearers can scarcely be overestimated.
Fatigue would be eliminated, and the old "joy in working" might
return. Not being based upon looks alone, &mdash; though the
&aelig;sthetic appeal should not be neglected, &mdash; the worker's
ability to work more and better with greater content of mind would
be the criterion. The success of the clothing would be
scientifically measured, the standards improved, and progress
itself become standardized.</p>
<p><b>Standard Methods Eliminate Fatigue.</b> &mdash; There is no
doubt in the minds of those who have made it a study, that the
constant receipt of the same kind of impressions, caused by the
same kind of stimulation of the same terminal sense organs, causes
semi-automatic response with less resulting fatigue, corresponding
to the lessened effort. All methods should, therefore, as far as
possible, be made up of standard elements under standard
conditions, with standard devices and appliances, and they should
be standardized from the standpoint of all of our senses as to
color, shape, size, weight, location, position and surface texture,
that the worker may grasp at a single thought by means of each or
all his senses, that no special muscles or other fatiguing
processes need be operated to achieve the standard result
desired.</p>
<p><b>Muscles That Tire Easily Should Be Saved.</b> &mdash; It must
be remembered that all work should be so arranged that the muscle
that changes the position or shape of the eye or the size of its
pupil should not <!--Page 169--><a name="P169" id="P169"></a> be
operated except when necessary. Care in planning can oftentimes
standardize conditions so as to relieve these and other muscles,
which grow tired easily, or transfer this work to other muscles
which are not so easily tired.</p>
<p>Not only do the reactions from such standards require less
bodily effort, but it also requires less mental effort to work
under methods that are standardized. Therefore, both directly and
indirectly, the worker benefits by the standardization.</p>
<p><b>Rest from Fatigue Is Provided for Scientifically.</b> &mdash;
Scientific Management provides and prescribes rest for overcoming
fatigue of the worker more scientifically and economically than he
could possibly provide it for himself. Weber's law is that "our
power of detecting differences between sensations does not depend
on the absolute amount of difference in the stimuli, but on the
relative amount."<a href="#ch06fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> The
additional fatigue from handling additional weights causes fatigue
to increase with the weight, but not in direct proportion to the
extra weight handled. When the correct weight of the unit to be
handled has been determined, the additional weight will cause
fatigue in quantities greater in proportion than the extra weight
handled.</p>
<p><b>Rest Periods Arranged for Best Good of Work and Worker.</b>
&mdash; If possible, rest from fatigue is so arranged as to
interfere with work the least. The necessary rest periods of the
individuals of a gang should come at that period of the cycle that
does not cause any allowance to be made for rest in between
<!--Page 170--><a name="P170" id="P170"></a> the performance of
the dependent operations of different members of the gang. Such an
arrangement will enable the worker to keep a sustained interest in
the work.</p>
<p><b>Work with Animals Should Be Standardized.</b> &mdash; The
necessity for standardizing work with animals has been greatly
underestimated, although it has been done more or less successfully
in systems for construction work. For work with horses and carts,
the harnesses and the carts should be standardized and standards
only should be used. The instruction card dealing with the action,
motions and their sequence should be standard to save time in
changing teams from the full to the empty cart and <i>vice
versa</i>. While standardized action is necessary with men, it is
even more necessary for men in connection with the work of animals,
such as horses, mules and oxen. The instruction card for the act of
changing of teams from an empty cart to a full cart should state
the side that the driver gets down from his seat to the ground, the
sequence in which he unhooks the harness and hooks it up again, and
the side on which he gets up to his seat in the cart. Even the
wording of his orders to his horse should be standardized.</p>
<p>While this book will deal with the human mind only, it is in
order to state that a book could be written to advantage on
training the horse by means of a standard man-horse language and a
standard practice of their combined action.</p>
<p>Animals have not the capacity for forming new habits that they
have for remembering the sequence <!--Page 171--><a name="P171" id=
"P171"></a> of former acts. They have little ability to adapt
themselves to a sequence of motions caused by unexpected
conditions, unless those conditions suggest the opportunity of
revenge, or the necessity of self-preservation, or immediate
welfare. This is only touched upon here from the man side.</p>
<p>Naturally, the output earning power of a man working with
animals depends largely upon the handling of the animal, and the
man can never attain his full output, or the managers get what they
might expect to get from the man-horse combination, until the
psychology of the horse, or mule, or elephant, or whatever animal
is used, is also studied and combined with the other studies on
Scientific Management.</p>
<p>An example of the benefits of standardized work with animals:
&mdash; The standard fire signals in the Fire House cause such
perfect horse action that fire horses always have a reputation for
superior intelligence.</p>
<p><b>The Worker Who Is Best Suited for His Work in the Performing
Department Is Incapable of Discovering the Best Method.</b> &mdash;
An exaggerated case of the result of leaving the selection of the
method to the worker is that of the West Indian negro who carried
the wheelbarrow on his head. <a href="#ch06fn12"><sup>12</sup></a>
This well-known example, though it seems impossible and absurd, is
no more inefficient than are hundreds of methods in use in the
industrial world to-day.</p>
<p><b>Under Scientific Management Quality Is Standardized.</b>
&mdash; Scientific Management determines exactly what quality as
well as what quantity of work is <!--Page 172--><a name="P172" id=
"P172"></a> needed, and the method prescribed is that one not
only of lower costs, but which fits the particular need of the
particular occasion most accurately.</p>
<p>Workers are kept under pressure for quality, yet the pressure is
not irksome, because the worker understands exactly what quality is
desired, and what variations from exactness are permitted.</p>
<p><b>Variations in Quality or Exactness Indicated by Standard
Signs.</b> &mdash; All dimensions on the drawings of work have
either a letter or symbol or plus or minus signs. There is much to
be said about the effect this has on the worker.</p>
<p>1. It gives the worker immediate knowledge of the prescribed
quality demanded.</p>
<p>2. He does not have to worry as to the maximum variation that he
can make without interfering with his bonus.</p>
<p>3. There is no fear of criticism or discharge for using his own
faulty judgment.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Has a Standard "Method of Attack."</b>
&mdash; We must note next the standard "method of attack" in
Scientific Management. It is recognized that sensations are
modified by those that come before, by those that come
simultaneously, and by those that follow. The psychic effect of
each and every kind of sensation depends upon what other sensations
have been experienced, are being experienced at that time, or will
presently be experienced. The scientific manager realizes this, and
provides for the most desirable sequence of sensation; then, having
seen, to the best of his ability, that the sensation occurs at the
time which he desires it to occur, he <!--Page 173--><a name="P173"
id="P173"></a> provides for concentration upon that one
sensation and elimination of all other thoughts or desires.</p>
<p>Professor Faraday says: "That part of self-education which
consists in teaching the mind to resist the desires and
inclinations until they are proved to be right is the most
important of all." How this is shown under Scientific Management
will be shown in "Teaching." It is sufficient to say here that the
method of attack of Scientific Management is to eliminate all
possible bodily as well as mental exertion, &mdash; to cut down
motions, to cut down even sensations and such mental acts as
visualizing. The object is, not so much to eliminate these motions
and these sensations, and this visualizing from the life of the
worker, as simply to use up less energy in producing the output.
This allows the worker an extra supply of energy upon which to fall
back to produce greater output and to get greater wages. If his
energy is not all utilized in his working hours, then, as will be
shown more clearly under "Welfare," there is that much more left
for him to enjoy in his own leisure time.</p>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p><b>Result to the Work.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional Management,
where standards are not established, the worker is constantly
delayed by the necessity for decision of choice, by the lack of
knowing what should be chosen, and by a dearth of standard
equipment, materials and tools from which to choose.</p>
<p>Under Transitory Management, with the introduction of standards,
the elimination of delays and the <!--Page 174--><a name="P174" id=
"P174"></a> provision for standard surroundings and supplies of
all kinds, comes increased output of the desired quality.</p>
<p>Under Scientific Management, not only is output increased and
quality assured, but results of work can be predicted. <a href=
"#ch06fn13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Results to the Worker.</b> &mdash; Results from
standardization to the worker under Traditional and Transitory
Management are the same as, and are included in, results under
Scientific Management.</p>
<p><b>State of Worker's Feelings Improved.</b> &mdash; Under
Scientific Management the state of the employ&eacute;'s feelings is
improved by the standardization. It is a recognized fact that
mental disturbance from such causes as fear of losing his job will
sometimes have the same ill effect upon a workman as does overwork,
or insufficient rest for overcoming fatigue. It will occasionally
wear upon the nervous system and the digestive organs. Now
Scientific Management by standardization removes from the workman
this fear of losing his job, for the worker knows that if he
conforms to the standard instructions he certainly will not lose
his position unless the business as a whole is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>On the other hand, feelings, such as happiness and contentment,
and even hearing rhythmic sounds, music, etc., are an aid toward
increasing output. For the best results, therefore, under
Scientific Management the worker is furnished with standard
conditions; his train of ideas is held upon the work in hand
without interruption, and the working conditions are
<!--Page 175--><a name="P175" id="P175"></a> such that the
managers furnish the worker with inducements to conform to the
standard conditions happily.</p>
<p><b>Worker's Retentive Power Increased.</b> &mdash; We note in
the second place, the increased retentive power of anyone who is
working with standards. There is great difference between different
people of the same degree of intelligence as to their ability to
memorize certain things, especially such as sequences of the
elements of a process. This lack of retentive power is illustrated
particularly well in the cases often found where the student has
difficulty in learning to spell. It is here that the standard
instruction card comes into play to good effect. Its great detail
remedies the defect in memorizing of certain otherwise brilliant
workers, and its standard form and repetition of standard phrases
aid the retentive power of the man who has a good memory.</p>
<p><b>Standard Elements Serve as Memory Drills.</b> &mdash; This
use of standardized elements makes the time elapsing between
repetitions shorter, for, while it may be a long time before the
worker again encounters the identical work or method, still, the
fact that elements are standard means that he will have occasion to
repeat elements frequently, and that his memory will each time be
further drilled by these repetitions.</p>
<p><b>Gang Instruction Card an Aid to Memory.</b> &mdash; The gang
instruction card has been used with good effect at the beginning of
unfamiliar repetitive cycles of work to train the memory of whole
gangs of men at once, and to cut down the elapsed time from the
time when one man's operation is sufficiently completed to
<!--Page 176--><a name="P176" id="P176"></a> permit the next man
to commence his. It has been found, in the case of setting timbers
in mill construction for example, that to have one man call out the
next act in the sequence as fast as the preceding one is finished,
until all have committed the sequence to memory, will materially
decrease the time necessary for the entire sequence of elements in
a cycle of work.</p>
<p><b>Individual Instruction Card an Inanimate Memory.</b> &mdash;
The instruction card supplies a most accurate memory in inanimate
form, that neither blurs nor distorts with age.</p>
<p>The ranter against this standard memory is no more sensible than
a man who would advocate the worker's forgetting the result of his
best experience, that his mind might be periodically exercised by
rediscovering the method of least waste anew with each problem.</p>
<p>Other things being equal, that worker has the longest number of
years of earning power who remembers the largest number of right
methods; or at least remembers where to find them described in
detail; and, conversely, those who have no memory, and know not
where to look for or to lay their hand on the method of least
waste, remain at the beginning of their industrial education.
"Experience," from an earning standpoint, does not exist when the
mind does not retain a memory of the method. The instruction card,
then, acts as a form of transferable memory &mdash; it conserves
memory. Once it is made, it furnishes the earning power without the
necessity of the former experience having been had more than
once.</p>
<!--Page 177--><a name="P177" id="P177"></a>
<p>Plans, details, free-hand sketches, and two-dimension
photographs surpass the highest form of mental imagery, and such
cultivated imagery is undoubtedly a high achievement. There is no
kind of memory, visualization, nor constructive imagination that
can equal the stereoscopic or three-dimension photographs that may
accompany the instruction card for enabling the worker to "see the
completed work before it is begun." Probably the greatest hindrance
to development of lower forms of animal life is their inability to
picture past experiences, and the reason for the intellectual
strides made by the worker under Scientific Management is the
development of this faculty.</p>
<p><b>A Conserver of Individual Memories.</b> &mdash; Many people
believe that the memory of a person ceases at his death. Whether
this is so or not, the loss to the world, and particularly the
industrial world, of not having the instruction card for the
passing on of the worker's experience to the workers who follow is
stupendous and incalculable, and this loss, like so many other
losses, can be eliminated by the process of making written
standards.</p>
<p><b>Motor Memory Improved by Standardization.</b> &mdash; Not
only are the retentive powers of the brain improved, but also the
brain centers, and the muscles, etc., become trained through
standardization. With standardization a long sequence of muscular
motions or operations can be noted at a glance, and can be
remembered without difficulty.</p>
<p><b>Standards Prevent Men from Becoming Machines.</b> &mdash;
Those who object to the worker taking advantage of these
scientifically derived standards which <!--Page 178--><a name=
"P178" id="P178"></a> aid the memory, can only be compared to
such people as desire the workers to turn into unthinking animals.
Psychologists believe that some of the lower animals have no
memory. Turning the workers into machines which do not in any way
utilize thought-saving devices is simply putting them but little
above the class of these lower, memory-less, animals.</p>
<p><b>Through Standards the Worker's Attention Is Gained at the
Start.</b> &mdash; The general act of attention plays an important
part in Scientific Management. The insistence upon standardized
performance requires the utmost attention at the beginning of
learning a new method of performance. This extra output of mental
activity, which is always required for accomplishing new methods of
work, could not be continuously maintained, but after the new
method has once been learned, its repetition requires less
attention, consequently less fatigue. The attention of the worker
is, therefore, strongly demanded at the beginning and when, later,
it is not needed except for new and unfamiliar work, an opportunity
arises for invention and mental advancement.</p>
<p><b>Attention Allowed to Lapse and Then Recalled.</b> &mdash;
Standardization shifts the objects of attention and eliminates the
need for constant concentration. The standardization of processes
relieves the worker to a marked extent from the extremely fatiguing
mental effort of unproductive fixed, valueless, and unnecessary
attention on the stream of consciousness. The repeated elements
which form a part of all standards reconcentrates the attention if
it is allowed to lapse.</p>
<!--Page 179--><a name="P179" id="P179"></a>
<p><b>Standardization Eliminates the Shifting Viewpoint.</b>
&mdash; Under old-time Traditional Management the way that the man
happened to feel at the particular time made a great difference,
not only in his work, but in his relations with other men. The
standardization not only of the relationship between the men, but
of the relationships between the foreman, the manager, and the
worker, the fact that the disciplining is put in the hands of a man
who is not biased by his personal feelings in his dealings with the
men; &mdash; all of these things mean that the viewpoint of the men
as to their work and their relationship remains fixed. This
standardizing of the viewpoint is an enormous help toward
increasing output.</p>
<p><b>The Common Viewpoint Is an Impetus.</b> &mdash; There are
those who believe that the concerted standard process of thought of
the many minds assists the operation of any one mind. However this
may be, there is no doubt that the fact that the standard thought
is present in all minds at one time at least eliminates some cause
for discussion and leads to unity and consequent success in the
work.</p>
<p><b>Invention Is Stimulated.</b> &mdash; Chances for invention
and construction are provided by standardization. <a href=
"#ch06fn14"><sup>14</sup></a> By having a scientifically derived
standard method as a starter, the worker can exert much of his
mental power toward improvement from that point upward, instead of
being occupied with methods below it and in wasting, perhaps, a
lifetime in striving to get up <!--Page 180--><a name="P180" id=
"P180"></a> to it,<a href="#ch06fn15"><sup>15</sup></a> this in
distinction to the old plan, where a worker knew only what he could
personally remember of what had been handed down by tradition,
tradition being the memory of society. Under Scientific Management
a worker has many repetitions of experience, some of which he does
not always recognize as such. When he does recognize them, he has
the power and daring for rapid construction that come to those only
who "know that they know."</p>
<p>Standardization of ultimate subdivisions, as such, brings that
power to the worker sooner. The conscious knowledge of familiarity
of process is an essential for attaining the complete benefits of
experience.</p>
<p>Far from making machines out of the men, standardization causes
a mental state that leads to invention, for the reason that the
worker's brain is in most intimate contact with the work, and yet
has not been unnecessarily fatigued by the work itself. No more
monotonous work could be cited than that of that boy whose sole
duty was to operate by hand the valve to the engine, yet he
invented the automatic control of the slide valve used throughout
the world to-day.</p>
<p><b>Standardization Prevents Accidents.</b> &mdash; The results
of standardization so far given, concern changes in the worker's
mental capacity, or attitude. Such changes, and other changes, will
be discussed from a different viewpoint under "Teaching." As for
results to the worker's body, one of the most important is the
elimination of causes for accidents.</p>
<p>The rigid inspection, testing, and repairing provided
<!--Page 181--><a name="P181" id="P181"></a> for by Scientific
Management provides against accidents from defects in equipment,
tools, or material. The fact that instructions are written,
provides against wrong methods of handling work. <a href=
"#ch06fn16"><sup>16</sup></a> The concentrated attention caused by
standardization, is a safeguard against accidents that occur from
the worker's carelessness.<a href="#ch06fn17"><sup>17</sup></a> The
proper allowance of rest for overcoming fatigue, insures that the
worker's mind is fresh enough to enable him to comply with
standards, and, finally, the spirit of co&ouml;peration that
underlies Scientific Management is an added check against
accidents, in that everyone is guarding his fellows as well as
himself.</p>
<p><b>Progress of Standardization Assured.</b> &mdash; As
Scientific Management becomes older, progress will be faster,
because up to this time there has been a hindrance standing in the
way of rapid advancement of the best standards. This hindrance has
been the tendency of habits of thought coinciding with former
practice. For example, the design of concrete building for years
followed the habit of thinking in terms of brick, or wood, or
steel, and then attempting to design and construct in reinforced
concrete. Again, in the case of the motor car, habits of thinking
in vehicles drawn by animals for years kept the design
unnecessarily leaning toward that of horse vehicles. As soon as
thought was in terms of power vehicles, the efficient motor truck
of to-day was made, using the power also for power loading and
power hoisting, <!--Page 182--><a name="P182" id="P182"></a> as
is now done in motor trucks specially designed for transporting and
handling pianos and safes. So, also, while the thought was of
traditional practice, standard practice was held back. Now that the
theories of standardization are well understood, standardization
and standards in general can advance with great rapidity.</p>

<h3>RECORDS AND PROGRAMMES</h3>
<p><b>Definition of Record.</b> &mdash; A record is, according to
the Century Dictionary &mdash; "something set down in writing or
delineated for the purpose of preserving memory; specifically a
register; an authentic or official copy of any writing, or an
account of any fact and proceedings, whether public or private,
usually entered in a book for preservation; also the book
containing such copy or account." <a href=
"#ch07fn01"><sup>1</sup></a> The synonyms given are "note,
chronicle, account, minute, memorandum."</p>
<p><b>Few Written Records Under Traditional Management.</b> &mdash;
For the purposes of this preliminary study of records, emphasis
will be laid on the fact that the record is written. Under
Traditional Management there are practically no such labor records.
What records are kept are more in the nature of "bookkeeping
records," as Gillette and Dana call them, records "showing debits
and credits between different accounts." In many cases, under
Traditional Management, not even such records of profit or loss
from an individual piece of work were kept, the manager, in extreme
cases, oftentimes "keeping his books in <!--Page 184--><a name=
"P184" id="P184"></a> his head" and having only the vaguest idea
of the state of his finances.</p>
<p><b>Importance of Records Realized Under Transitory
Management.</b> &mdash; As has been amply demonstrated in
discussing Individuality and Standardization, the recognition of
the value of records is one of the first indications of Transitory
Management. Since this stage of management has Scientific
Management in view as "a mark to come to," the records evolved and
used are not discarded by Scientific Management, but are simply
perfected. Therefore, there is no need to discuss these transitory
records, except to say that, from the start, <i>quality</i> of
records is insisted upon before quantity of records.</p>
<p><b>No "Bookkeeping" Records Under Scientific Management.</b>
&mdash; Under Scientific Management there are no "bookkeeping
records" kept of costs as such. Instead, there are "time and cost
records," so called, of the time and efficiency of performance.
From these, costs can be deduced at any time. Items of cost without
relation to their causes, on work that is not to be repeated, have
little value. Cost records, as such, usually represent a needless,
useless expenditure of time and money. It must be emphasized that
Scientific Management can in no way be identified with "cost
keeping," in the sense that is understood to mean aimlessly
recording unrelated costs. Under Scientific Management costs are an
ever-present by-product of the system, not a direct product.</p>
<p><b>Records Must Lower Costs and Simplify Work.</b> &mdash; The
quantity of records that should be made depends on the amount,
diversity and state of development <!--Page 185--><a name="P185"
id="P185"></a> of the work done. No record should be made, which
does not, directly or indirectly, actually reduce costs or in some
way increase efficiency. The purpose of the records, as of
Scientific Management in general, is to simplify work. Only when
this is recognized, can the records made be properly judged.
Numerous as they may at times seem to be, their number is
determined absolutely by the satisfactory manner in which they
&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Reduce costs.</p>
<p>2. Simplify work.</p>
<p>3. Increase efficiency.</p>
<p><b>Records of Work and Workers.</b> &mdash; Records may be of
the work or of the worker <a href="#ch07fn02"><sup>2</sup></a>
&mdash; that is to say, of material used, tools used, output
produced, etc., or of individual efficiency, in one form or
another. Records of efficiency may be of workers, of foremen, and
of managers, and a record may be made of any man in several
capacities; for example, a record is kept of a functional foreman
in the form of the work of the men who are under him, while another
record might be kept of him as a worker himself; for example, the
time being taken that it took him to teach others their duties, the
time to learn what was to be done on any new work, etc.</p>
<p><b>Records of Initiative.</b> &mdash; Records of initiative are
embodied in the Suggestion Card. Even under advanced Traditional
Management the cards are furnished to the men upon which to write
any ideas as to improvements. These suggestions are received, and,
if accepted, are rewarded.</p>
<!--Page 186--><a name="P186" id="P186"></a>
<p>Under Scientific Management such suggestions become more
valuable, for, as has been shown, they are based upon standards;
thus if accepted, they signify not only a real, but a permanent
improvement. Their greatest value, however, is in the stimulus that
they furnish to the worker, in the information that they furnish
the management as to which workers are interested, and in the
spirit of co&ouml;peration that they foster.</p>
<p>The worker receives not only a money-reward, but also publicity,
for it is made known which worker has made a valuable suggestion.
This indicates that the worker has shown good judgment. His
interest is thus stimulated, his attention is held to his work, and
the habit of initiative comes to him. That this habit of initiative
can be fostered, is shown by the actual fact that in many sorts of
work the same man constantly makes suggestions. It becomes a habit
with him to look for the new way, and as he is constantly rewarded,
the interest is not allowed to diminish.</p>
<p><b>Records of Good Behavior.</b> &mdash; Records of good
behavior are incorporated in the White List File. The White List
File contains the names of all men who have ever been employed who
merit a recommendation, if they should go to work for others, and
would deserve to be given work as soon as possible, if they came
back. This White List File should be filled out with many details,
but even if it contains nothing but a record of the names, and the
addresses where the men can be reached when new work starts up, it
has a stimulating effect upon the worker. He feels,
<!--Page 187--><a name="P187" id="P187"></a> again, the element
of permanence; there is a place for individuality, and not only
does the manager have the satisfaction of actually having this
list, and of using it, but a feeling that his men know that he is
in some way recognizing them, and endeavoring to make them and
their good work permanent.</p>
<p><b>Records of Achievement.</b> &mdash; Records of achievement
vary with the amount and nature of the work done. Such records are,
as far as possible, marked upon programmes.</p>
<p><b>Records Made by Worker Where Possible.</b> &mdash; Wherever
possible the worker makes his own records. Even when this is not
advisable he is informed of his record at as short intervals as are
practicable.<a href="#ch07fn03"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Records Made on the "Exception Principle."</b> &mdash; Much
time is saved by separating records for the inspection of the man
above, simply having him examine the exceptions to some desired
condition, &mdash; the records which are exceptionally good, the
records which are exceptionally bad. This not only serves as a
reward to the man who has a good record, and a punishment for the
man who has had a bad record, but it also enables the manager to
discover at once what is wrong and where it is wrong, and to remedy
it.</p>
<p>The value of the exception principle can hardly be
overestimated. It would be of some value to know of exceptionally
good or poor work, even if the cause were not known. At least one
would be made to observe the signpost of success or of danger. But,
<!--Page 188--><a name="P188" id="P188"></a> under Scientific
Management, the cause appears simultaneously with the fact on the
record, &mdash; thus not only indicating the proper method of
repeating success, or avoiding failure, in the future, but also
showing, and making clear, the direct relation of cause to effect,
to the worker himself.</p>
<p><b>This Discussion Necessarily Incomplete.</b> &mdash; The
records mentioned above are only a few of the types of records
under Scientific Management. Discussion has been confined to these,
because they have the most direct effect upon the mind of the
worker and the manager. Possible records are too numerous, and too
diverse, to be described and discussed in detail. They constitute a
part of the "how" of Scientific Management, &mdash; the manner in
which it operates. This is covered completely in the literature of
Scientific Management, written by men who have made Scientific
Management and its installation a life study. We need only further
discuss the posting of records, and their effect.</p>
<p><b>Posting of Records Beneficial.</b> &mdash; As has been
already noted under Individuality, and must be again noted under
Incentives, much benefit is derived from posting records,
especially when these are of such a character, or are so posted,
that the worker may see at a glance the comparative excellence of
his results.</p>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p><b>Results of Records to the Work.</b> <a href=
"#ch07fn04"><sup>4</sup></a> &mdash; The results of recording are
the same under all forms of management, if the records are
correct.</p>
<!--Page 189--><a name="P189" id="P189"></a>
<p>Output increases where records are kept. Under Traditional
Management there is the danger that pressure for quantity will
affect quality, especially if insufficient records of the resultant
quality are kept. Under Transitory and Scientific Management,
quality is maintained or improved, both because previous records
set the standard, and because following records exhibit the
quality.</p>
<p><b>Results to the Worker.</b> &mdash; James says, "A man's
social use is the recognition which he gets from his mates. We are
not only gregarious animals, liking to be liked in sight of our
fellow, but we have an innate propensity to get ourselves noticed,
and noticed favorably, by our kind. No more fiendish punishment
could be devised, were such a thing physically possible, than that
one should be turned loose in society and remain absolutely
unnoticed by all the members thereof. If no one turned around when
we entered, answered when we spoke or minded what we did, but if
every person we met 'cut us dead' and acted as if we were
non-existing things, a kind of rage and impotent despair would ere
long well up in us, from which the cruelest bodily tortures would
be a relief; for these would make us feel that, however bad might
be our plight, we had not sunk to such a depth as to be unworthy of
attention at all."<a href="#ch07fn05"><sup>5</sup></a> This
recognition the worker gets partly through the records which are
made of him.</p>
<p><b>Self-Knowledge Attained Through Records.</b> &mdash; Through
records of output, and especially through charts of such records,
and timed motion-picture films, <!--Page 190--><a name="P190" id=
"P190"></a> or micro-motion study pictures the worker may, if he
be naturally observant, or if he be taught to observe, gain a fine
knowledge of himself.</p>
<p>The constant exhibit of cause and effect of the relation of
output to, for example, &mdash; drink of alcoholic beverages; to
smoking; to food values; to nutrition; to family worries; and to
other outside influences; &mdash; in fact, the effects of numerous
different modes of living, are shown promptly to the worker in the
form of records.</p>
<p>Two things should here be noted:</p>
<p>1. The necessity of having more accurate records of the worker
and the work, that the relation o&pound; cause to effect may be
more precise and authentic.</p>
<p>2. The necessity for so training the worker, before, as well as
after, he enters the industrial world, that he can better
understand and utilize the lesson taught by his own records and
those of others.</p>
<p><b>Educative Value of Worker Making His Own Record.</b> &mdash;
Under Scientific Management in its most highly developed form, the
worker makes his own records on his return cards and hands them in.
The worker thus not only comes to realize, by seeing them and by
writing them down, what his records are, but he also realizes his
individual position to-day compared to what it was yesterday, and
compared to that of his fellows in the same line of work. Further,
he gains accuracy, he gains judgment, he gains a method of attack.
He realizes that, as the managers are more or less recorders, so
also he, in recording himself, is vitally connected with the
management. It is, after all, more or less an attitude of mind
which he gains <!--Page 191--><a name="P191" id="P191"></a> by
making out these records himself. It is because of this attitude of
mind, and of the value which it is to him, that he is made to make
out his own record under the ultimate form of management, even
though at times this may involve a sacrifice of the time in which
he must do it, and although he may work slower than could a
specialist at recording, who perhaps would, in spite of that, be
paid less for doing the work.</p>
<p><b>Exact Knowledge Valuable.</b> &mdash; We cannot emphasize too
often in this connection the far-reaching psychological effect upon
the worker of exact knowledge of the comparative efficiency of
methods. The value of this is seldom fully appreciated; for
example, we are familiar with the many examples where the worker
has been flattered until he believes that he cannot make mistakes
or do inefficient work. This is most often found where the glowing
compliments to the manufacturing department, found in the
advertising pages of the magazine and in the praises sung in print
by the publicity department, oftentimes ends in an individual
overconfidence. This unjustified self-esteem is soon shattered by
accurate comparative records.</p>
<p>On the other hand, hazing of the new worker and the sneers of
the jealous, accompanied by such trite expressions as &mdash; "You
can't teach an old dog new tricks," have often destroyed
self-confidence in a worker, who, in the absence of accurate
records of his efficiency, is trying to judge himself at new
methods. The jibes and jokes at the new man at the new work, and
especially at the experienced, efficient man at unfamiliar
<!--Page 192--><a name="P192" id="P192"></a> work cease, or at
least are wholly impotent, so far as discouraging the man is
concerned, provided the worker sees by the records of a true
measuring device, or method, that his work compares favorably with
others of the same experience, made under the same conditions.</p>
<p><b>Definition of Programme.</b> &mdash; The word "programme" is
defined by the Century Dictionary as "a method of operation or line
of procedure prepared or announced beforehand. An outline or
abstract of something to be done or carried out."</p>
<p><b>Two Meanings of "Programme" in Management.</b> &mdash; The
word "programme" has two meanings in management.</p>
<p>1. the work, as it comes to the management to be done</p>
<p>2. the work as it is planned out by the managers, and handed
over to the worker to be done.</p>
<p>Programme as here used is a plan for doing work, the plan which
the planning department lays out and hands over for the performers,
or the workers, to do.</p>
<p><b>Under Traditional Management No Accurate Programme Is
Possible.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional Management the plan is at
best a repetition of records of unscientifically planned work. The
most that the managers can hope to do is to lay out the time in
which they expect, after consulting previous elapsed time records,
the work to be done. Methods are not prescribed, so there is no
assurance that the calendar will be followed, for the times are set
by guess, or at best by referring to old unscientifically made
records.</p>
<!--Page 193--><a name="P193" id="P193"></a>
<p><b>Under Transitory Management Calendars Can Be Designed.</b>
&mdash; Under Transitory Management, with the introduction of
systems, that is, records of how the work has been done best at
various times, come methods and a possibility of a more exact
calendar. There is some likelihood under Transitory System of the
work being done on time, as the method has been considered and, in
many cases, is specified.</p>
<p><b>Under Scientific Management Accurate Calendars Possible.</b>
&mdash; Under Scientific Management programmes are based on
accurate records scientifically made and standardized, and a
calendar may be made that can be conformed to with exactness.</p>
<p><b>Programmes a Matter of Routing.</b> &mdash; The problems of a
programme under Scientific Management are two, both problems of
routing: &mdash;</p>
<p>1. to route materials to the work place.</p>
<p>2. to route the worker to the placed materials.</p>
<p>At first glance it might seem simpler to consider the worker as
static and the materials as in motion. The "routing" of the worker
is really often not a question of motion at all, as the worker, if
he were operating a machine, for example, would not change his
position between various pieces of work &mdash; except to rest from
fatigue &mdash; enough to be considered. The word "routing" is used
figuratively as regards the worker. He is considered as transported
by the management through the day's work.</p>
<p>But, whether the work move, or the worker, or both, programmes
must so plan out the progress of each, in detail, for as many days
ahead as possible, that the most efficient outcome will ensue.</p>
<!--Page 194--><a name="P194" id="P194"></a>
<p><b>Routing of Work.</b> &mdash; The work is routed through
schedules of materials to buy, schedules of material to handle, and
schedules of labor to be performed. The skilled worker finds all
the materials for his work ready and waiting for him when he
arrives at the task, this being provided for by programmes made out
many tasks ahead.</p>
<p><b>Routing of Workers.</b> &mdash; The workers themselves are
routed by means of the route sheet, route chart, pin plan and
bulletin board.</p>
<p>The devices for laying out the work of the workers appeal to the
imagination as well as the reason. The route chart is a graphical
representation of a large river, starting with the small stream,
&mdash; the first operation, gathering to itself as the
tributaries, the various other operations, &mdash; till it reaches
its full growth, the completed work.</p>
<p>The pin plan, with each pin or flag representing a worker, or
work place, and following his progress on a plan of the work,
presents a bird's-eye view in miniature of the entire working
force; and the bulletin board, with its cards that represent work
ahead, not only eliminates actual delay of shifting from one task
to another, but permits studying out one task while doing another,
and also destroys all fear of delay between jobs.</p>
<p><b>Impossibility of Describing Routing Devices Accurately.</b>
&mdash; These routing devices might all be described at length, but
no description could do them justice. A visit to a shop, or
factory, or other industrial organization operating under
Scientific Management is necessary, in order to appreciate not only
<!--Page 195--><a name="P195" id="P195"></a> their utility, but
the interest that they arouse. These programmes are no dead, static
things. They are alive, pulsing, moving, progressing with the
progress of the work.</p>
<p><b>Prophecy Becomes Possible Under Scientific Management.</b>
&mdash; The calendar, or chronological chart, becomes a true
prophecy of what will take place. This is based on the standardized
elementary units, and the variations from it will be so slight as
to allow of being disregarded.</p>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p><b>Results of Programme to the Work.</b> &mdash; Under
Traditional Management the tentative calendar might cause speed,
but could not direct speed. Under Transitory Management elimination
of waste by prescribed methods and routing increases output. This
increase becomes greater under Scientific Management. Standardized
routing designs the shortest paths, the least wasteful sequence of
events, the most efficient speed, the most fitting method. The
result is more and better work.</p>
<p><b>Results of Programmes to the Worker.</b> &mdash; A programme
clarifies the mind, is definite. The Traditional worker was often
not sure what he had better do next. The worker under Scientific
Management knows exactly what he is to do, and where and how he is
to do it.</p>
<p>The attention is held, a field of allied interests are provided
for possible lapses, as are also methods for recalling
attention.</p>
<p>The programme provides for a look ahead, and the
<!--Page 196--><a name="P196" id="P196"></a> relief that comes
from seeing the path before one. This ability to foresee also leads
to a feeling of stability. The knowledge that there is a large
amount of work ahead, ready to be attacked with no delay,
eliminates anxiety as to future employment. This allows of
concentration on the work in hand, and a feeling that, this work
being properly done, one is free to turn to the next piece of work
with the absolute assurance that what has been done will be
satisfactory.</p>
<p><b>Relation Between Records and Programmes.</b> &mdash; No
discussion of records and programmes would be complete that did not
consider the relation between them.</p>
<p><b>Importance of This Relation.</b> &mdash; The relation between
records and programmes in the various types of management is most
important, for the progress from one type to another may be studied
as exemplified in the change in these relations.</p>
<p><b>A Broadening of the Definitions.</b> &mdash; In order to
understand more plainly the complexity of this relation, we will
not confine ourselves here to the narrower definition of a record
as a written account, but will consider it to mean a registering of
an experience in the mind, whether this expresses itself in a
written record or not, A programme will, likewise, be a mental
plan.</p>
<p><b>Many Possible Types of Records and Programmes.</b> &mdash; In
order to understand the number of different types of records and
programmes that can be made for a worker, the table that follows
may be examined (Table I). It exemplifies twelve possible records
and twelve possible programmes. <!--Page 197--><a name="P197" id=

<!--Page 198--><a name="P198" id="P198"></a>
<p><b>Interrelation of These Types.</b> &mdash; The man is
classified first, as working for himself, or working for another.
There will usually be a fundamental difference, at the outset, in
the minds of these two men, for the man working for himself will be
of a more independent cast of thought. There will be no question as
to the man's output showing up separately, unless he chooses to
prevent this by having others work with him. Neither will there be
any question but that, if a record is made, he makes it himself,
unless someone who is not vitally connected with the work, as some
onlooker, interested or disinterested, should make the records for
him. But the typical case of the man working for himself would be
that he was working as an individual, and that the record was made
by himself. There would then be four kinds of records &mdash; an
unconscious record, a conscious record not written, a written
record and a standardized record. The "unconscious record" would
be, in reality, no record at all. It would simply be, that
somewhere in the man's mind there would be a record of what he had
done, which, except as a "fringe of consciousness" would not
particularly influence his programme. What we mean by a "conscious
record" would be more of a set habit, the man knowing that he had
done the work in a certain way. This would begin to influence, more
or less, his programme, and also his knowledge of his capacity for
work. With a written record, would come a thorough knowledge on his
part of what he had done and how he had done it, and we must note
that with this written record <!--Page 199--><a name="P199" id=
"P199"></a> comes the possibility for some sort of a set
programme, the man knowing what it will be possible to do, and how
he had best do it. With the standardized record comes the
standardized method.</p>
<p><b>Relationships Complex.</b> &mdash; When we consider the man
working for another, he may either be one of a gang, or one whose
work is considered as that of an individual. In either case, any of
the four sorts of records can be made of his work that have been
already described for the man working for himself. Each one of
these records may be made by the man, or by the management; for
with the man working for another, naturally the second mind, that
of the other, or the manager, enters in, and a great many more
combinations are possible.</p>
<p>For example, &mdash; there might be an unconscious record made
by the man and a conscious record, or a written record, made by the
manager. There might be a conscious record made by the man, but an
unconscious or a written record made by the manager, etc. There are
too many combinations made to be here considered. Each one of these
combinations would have a definite and a different effect, both
upon the mind of the man, and upon the mind of the manager; and
also upon their relation to each other. The second half of this
chart is similar, but treats of programmes, as many variables enter
here.</p>
<p>It may be thought that the details of the preceding chart and
the three following charts are uninteresting, obvious, and show too
many possible combinations. If this be so, then it is most
necessary to include them <!--Page 200--><a name="P200" id=
"P200"></a> to illustrate the conditions that are passed through
and slipped back into too often in our schools, our apprenticeship
and in all but the best of managements.</p>
<p>The outline of advancement must be known and recognized if the
quality of teaching, efficiency, and management is to be graded in
its right class.</p>
<p>When we consider that each type of record bears a relation to
each type of programme, the complexity of the problems involved
become apparent. This will be better shown in Table II.</p>

<p><b>Illustration of This Complexity.</b> &mdash; Table II
represents the man working for himself, with subdivisions under it
showing the possible relationship between his record and his
programme. We find that these are at least ten, reaching all the
way from the unconscious record and unconscious programme of the
migrating transitory laborer to the standardized record and the
standardized programme of the manager who manages himself
scientifically.</p>
<p>Each one of these represent a distinct psychological stage. The
progression may not be regular and smooth as is here given, &mdash;
it may be a jump, possibly even from one to nine. It may, however,
be a slow progression from one stage to another, largely to be
determined by the type of mind that is considered, and the
opportunities for development along scientific lines which are
afforded. It is the writer's intention to discuss these at length
at some other time. Here it is only possible to enumerate, in order
to show the size and complexity of the problem which is here
involved.</p>
<p>The table does not indicate, as perhaps it should, the fact that
the relationship between an unconscious record and an unconscious
programme is slight, while the relation between a written programme
and a written record is very close indeed. In Table IV this will be
indicated.</p>

<p><b>Elimination of Waste Possible.</b> &mdash; The third table
&mdash; that of the man working for another man &mdash; attempts
to do no more than indicate the first and last step of a long
series, beginning with the man, one of a gang, an unconscious
record, and an unconscious programme, on the part of both the
manager and the man, down to the final stage of individual output,
with the written record and programme known to both manager and
man. It would be a most interesting problem to work out the various
steps stretching between these two, and the various ways in which
progression might be made through these steps, either taking one
step after another slowly or making the various possible jumps long
and short. A psychological discussion of each step would be of
value, and certainly must in time be made, but this book has not
the scope, nor can the time be devoted to such a discussion.</p>
<p>If this third chart had no other purpose, it would be useful to
suggest to the student the wide tracts which still remain for study
and development. It must not be thought that any of the steps
omitted on this chart are not in existence. Every single possible
combination of record and programme is in existence to-day, and
must be studied by the manager of men. Not until these are all
discovered, described, <!--Page 203--><a name="P203" id=
"P203"></a> and standardized, the progression noted, and
standard progressions outlined, can methods of least waste be
adopted.</p>
<p>With a more thorough experimental study of the mind will come a
possible prediction as to which stages the various types of mind
must pass through. So, too, with the training of the young mind in
the primary schools and in the methods of Scientific Management,
will come the elimination of many stages now necessary, and the
possibility, even, that the final stage may be introduced at the
outset, and the enormous waste of time, energy and wearing of
unnecessary brain paths be absolutely abolished.</p>
<p><b>The Programme Derived from the Record.</b> &mdash; Having
considered the various records and programmes and their relation,
we will now consider the four stages of the record, &mdash; (1)
unconscious, (2) conscious, (3) written, (4) standardized, and
trace the derivation of the programme from each stage.</p>

<p><b>Unconscious Records Mean Indefinite Programmes.</b> &mdash;
First, then, suppose that the records are unconscious. What does
this imply? It implies in the first place that the worker has no
idea of his capacity; never having thought of what he has done, he
has no idea what can be done, neither has he a comparative idea of
methods, that is, of how to do it. It is impossible for a definite
programme to be laid out by such a worker, &mdash; that is to say,
no predictions by him as to the time of completing the work are
possible. Neither could a method be derived by him from his
previous work.</p>
<p>Note here the alarming amount of waste. All good methods which
the worker may possibly have acquired are practically lost to the
world, and perhaps also to him. Not only this, but all bad methods
which he has fallen into will be fallen into again and again, as
there are no warning signs to keep him out of them.</p>
<p>As there is no possibility of an accurate chronological chart,
the worker may undertake more than he can do, thus delaying work
which should have been done by others. On the other hand, he may
underestimate his capacity, and be left idle because work he should
have done has been assigned to others. Either of these leads to a
sense of insecurity, to wavering attention, to "hit or miss" guess
work, "rule-of- <!--Page 205--><a name="P205" id="P205"></a>
thumb methods," which are the signs of Traditional Management.</p>
<p><b>With Conscious and Written Records Come Definite
Programmes.</b> &mdash; We turn now to the case where the record is
conscious, &mdash; that is, where the worker keeps in mind exactly
what he has done. With this conscious record the idea of capacity
develops. The man realizes what he can do. So also, the idea of
method develops, and the man realizes how he can do the work.
Third, there comes gradually an idea of a margin; that is, of a
possible way by which capacity can be increased for a higher speed,
or methods can be slightly varied to meet any particular deviation
in the work to be done.</p>
<p>From this ability to estimate capacity, and to plan the method
ahead, comes the ability to lay out a more definite programme. When
the record becomes written the exactness of the programme
increases. Methods also become written, and, though accurate
prediction is not possible, such prediction is more and more nearly
approached. This increasing accuracy is the work of Transitory
System in all its stages.</p>
<p><b>Standard Records Permit of Standard Programmes.</b> &mdash;
In the last case, the record is standardized, that is, the result
of the method of processes of analysis and synthesis. Through this
process, as has been shown, the reason for success is discovered
and rendered usable. The programme becomes standard, results can be
predicted accurately, and methods by which these results can be
best obtained are also standard.</p>
<p>It may at first escape notice that these standardized
<!--Page 206--><a name="P206" id="P206"></a> records, of the
ultimate or scientific management type, imply <i>not</i> a greater
rigidity, but a greater elasticity. This because of the nature of
the elements of the records, which may, in time, be combined into a
great number of different, predictable programmes.</p>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p><b>Results of Relations Between Records and Programmes on the
Work.</b> &mdash; The most noteworthy result of the closer
relations between records and programmes which appear during the
evolution of Scientific Management is the fact that they cause
constant simplification. The more carefully records are
standardized, the simpler becomes the drafting of the programme. As
more and more records become standard, the drafting of programmes
becomes constantly an easier and cheaper process.</p>
<p><b>Programmes Become Records.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional
Management the record that follows a programme may appear very
different from the programme. Under Scientific Management the
record that follows a programme most closely resembles the
programme. Improvements are not made between the programme and the
following record, &mdash; they find their place between the record
and the following programme. Thus programmes and records may be
grouped in pairs, by similarity, with a likelihood of difference
between any one pair (one programme plus one record) and other
pairs.</p>
<p><b>Result on the Worker.</b> &mdash; The greatest effect, on the
worker, of these relations of record to programme under Scientific
Management is the confidence that he <!--Page 207--><a name="P207"
id="P207"></a> gains in the judgment that is an outcome of
Scientific Management. When the worker sees that Scientific
Management makes possible accurate predictions of times, schedules,
tasks, and performance; that the methods prescribed invariably
enable him to achieve prescribed results, his confidence in
Scientific Management grows. So also does the manager's confidence
in Scientific Management grow, &mdash; and in this mutual
confidence in the system of management is another bond of
sympathy.</p>
<p>The place left for suggestions and improvements, in the
ever-present opportunities to better standards, fulfills that
longing for a greater efficiency that is the cause of progress.</p>

<h3>TEACHING</h3>
<p><b>Definition of Teaching.</b> &mdash; The Century Dictionary
defines "teaching" as "the act or business of instructing," with
synonyms: "training" and "education;" and "to teach" is defined:
&mdash;</p>
<p>1. "to point out, direct, show;" "to tell, inform, instruct,
explain;"</p>
<p>2. "to show how (to do something); hence, to train;"</p>
<p>3. "to impart knowledge or practical skill to;" "to guide in
learning, educate."</p>
<p>"Educate," we find meaning "to instruct, to teach methodically,
to prescribe to; to indoctrinate;" and by "indoctrinate" is meant
"to cause to hold as a doctrine or belief." "To educate," says the
same authority, "is to develop mentally or morally by instruction;
to qualify by instruction and training for the business and duty of
life."</p>
<p><b>Under Traditional Management No Definite Plan of
Teaching.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional Management there is either
no definite scheme of teaching by the management itself, or
practically none; at least, this is usually the condition under the
most elementary types of Traditional Management. In the very
highest examples of the traditional plan the learner may
<!--Page 209--><a name="P209" id="P209"></a> be shown how, but
this showing is not usually done in a systematic way, and under
so-called Traditional Management is seldom in the form of written
instructions.</p>
<p><b>No Specified Time for or Source of the Teaching.</b> &mdash;
Under Traditional Management there is no particular time in which
this teaching goes on, no particular time allowed for the worker to
ask for the instruction, nor is there any particular source from
which he obtains the instructions. There is, moreover, almost every
hindrance against his getting any more instruction than he
absolutely must have in order to get the work done. The persons to
whom he can possibly appeal for further information might discharge
him for not already knowing. These persons are, if he is an
apprentice, an older worker; if he is a journeyman, the worker next
to him, or the foreman, or someone over him. An important fact
bearing on this subject is that it is not to the pecuniary
advantage of any particular person to give this teaching. In the
first place, if the man be a fellow-worker, he will want to do his
own work without interruption, he will not want to take the time
off; moreover, he regards his particular skill as more or less of a
trade secret, and desires to educate no more people than necessary,
to be as clever as he is. In the third place, there is no possible
reward for giving this instruction. Of course, the worker
necessarily improves under any sort of teaching, and if he has a
receptive mind, or an inventive mind, he must progress constantly,
either by teaching himself or by the instruction, no matter how
haphazard.</p>
<!--Page 210--><a name="P210" id="P210"></a>
<p><b>Great Variation Under Traditional Management.</b> &mdash;
Only discussion of teaching under this type of management with many
men who have learned under it, can sufficiently emphasize the
variations to be found. But the consensus of opinion would seem to
prove that an apprentice of only a generation ago was too often
hazed, was discouraged from appealing for assistance or advice to
the workers near him, or to his foreman; was unable to find
valuable literature for home-study on the subject of his trade. The
experience of many an apprentice was, doubtless, different from
this, but surely the mental attitude of the journeymen who were the
only teachers must have tended toward some such resulting attitude
of doubt or hesitancy in the apprentice.</p>
<p><b>Mental Attitude of the Worker-Teacher.</b> &mdash; Under the
old plan of management, the apprentice must appear to the
journeyman more or less of a supplanter. From the employee's
standpoint it was most desirable that the number of apprentices be
kept down, as an oversupply of labor almost invariably resulted in
a lowering of wages. The quicker and better the apprentice was
taught, the sooner he became an active competitor. There seldom
existed under this type of management many staff positions to which
the workers could hope to be promoted, certainly none where they
could utilize to the fullest extent their teaching ability. There
was thus every reason for a journeyman to regard the teaching of
apprentices as unremunerative, irksome, and annoying.</p>
<p><b>Worker Not to Blame for This.</b> &mdash; The worker is
<!--Page 211--><a name="P211" id="P211"></a> not to be blamed
for this attitude. The conditions under which he worked made it
almost inevitable. Not only could he gain little or nothing by
being a successful teacher, but also the bullying instinct was
appealed to constantly, and the desire of the upper classmen in
hazing days to make the next class "pay up" for the hazing that
they were obliged to endure in their Freshman year.</p>
<p><b>Attitude of the Learner.</b> &mdash; The attitude of the
typical learner must frequently be one of hesitancy and
self-distrust if not of fear, though conditions were so varied as
almost to defy classification. One type of apprentice was expected
to learn merely by observation and imitation. Another was
practically the chore boy of the worker who was assigned to teach
him. A third was under no direct supervision at all, but was
expected to "keep busy," finding his work by himself. A fourth was
put through a severe and valuable training by a martinet teacher,
&mdash; and so on.</p>
<p><b>Teaching Often Painstaking.</b> &mdash; It is greatly to the
credit of the worker under this type of management that he was, in
spite of all drawbacks, occasionally a painstaking teacher, to the
best of his lights. He insisted on application, and especially on
quality of work. He unselfishly gave of his own time and skill to
help the apprentice under him.</p>
<p><b>Methods of Teaching Usually Wrong.</b> &mdash; Unfortunately,
through no fault of the worker-teacher the teaching was usually
done according to wrong methods. Quality of resulting output was so
emphasized that neither speed nor correct motions were given proper
consideration.</p>
<!--Page 212--><a name="P212" id="P212"></a>
<p><b>Teacher Not Trained to Teach.</b> &mdash; The reason for this
was that the worker had no training to be a teacher. In the first
place, he had no adequate idea of his own capabilities, and of
which parts of his own method were fit to be taught. In the second
place, he did not know that right motions must be insisted on
first, speed next, and quality of output third; or in other words
that if the motions were precise enough, the quality would be
first. In the fourth place he had no pedagogical training.</p>
<p><b>Lack of Standards an Underlying Lack.</b> &mdash; All
shortcoming in the old time teaching may be traced to lack of
standards. The worker had never been measured, hence had no idea of
his efficiency, or of possible efficiency. No standard methods made
plain the manner in which the work should be done. Moreover, no
standard division and assignment of work allowed of placing
apprentices at such parts of the work that quality could be given
third place. No standard requirements had determined his fitness as
a teacher, nor the specialty that he should teach, and no incentive
held his interest to the teaching. These standards the
worker-teacher could not provide for himself, and the wonder is
that the teaching was of such a high character as it was.</p>
<p><b>Very Little Teaching of Adults.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional
Management, teaching of adults was slight, &mdash; there being
little incentive either to teacher or to learner, and it being
always difficult for an adult to change his method. <a href=
"#ch08fn01"><sup>1</sup></a> Moreover, it would be difficult for a
worker using one method to persuade one using
<!--Page 213--><a name="P213" id="P213"></a> another that his
was the better, there being no standard. Even if the user of the
better did persuade the other to follow his method, the final
result might be the loss of some valuable elements of the poorer
method that did not appear in the better.</p>
<p><b>Failure to Appreciate the Importance of Teaching.</b> &mdash;
An underestimation of the importance of teaching lay at the root of
the lack of progress. This is so directly connected with all the
other lacks of Traditional Management, &mdash; provision for
adequate promotion and pay, standards, and the other underlying
principles of Scientific Management, especially the appreciation of
co&ouml;peration, &mdash; that it is almost impossible to
disentangle the reasons for it. Nor would it be profitable to
attempt to do so here. In considering teaching under Scientific
Management we shall show the influence of the appreciation of
teaching, &mdash; and may deduce the lacks from its
non-appreciation, from that discussion.</p>
<p><b>Under Transitory System Teaching Becomes More Important.</b>
&mdash; Under Transitory Management the importance of teaching
becomes at once more apparent. This, both by providing for the
teaching of foremen and journeymen as well as apprentices, and by
the providing of written systems of instructions as to best
practice. The worker has access to all the sources of information
of Traditional Management, and has, besides these, in effect,
unsystematically derived standards to direct him.</p>
<p><b>Systems Make Instruction Always Available.</b> &mdash; The
use of written systems enables every worker to receive instruction
at any time, to feel free to ask <!--Page 214--><a name="P214" id=
"P214"></a> it, and to follow it without feeling in any way
humiliated.</p>
<p>The result of the teaching of these systems is a decided
improvement in methods. If the written systems are used exclusively
as a source of teaching, except for the indefinite teachers of the
Traditional Management, the improvement becomes definitely
proportioned to the time which the man spends upon the studying and
to the amount of receptive power which he naturally has.</p>
<p><b>Incentives to Conform to System.</b> &mdash; The worker has
incentives to follow the systems &mdash;</p>
<p>1. In that he is required to render reasons in writing for
permanent filing, for every disobedience of system.</p>
<p>2. That, as soon as work is placed on the bonus basis, the first
bonus that is given is for doing work in accordance with the
prescribed method.</p>
<p>Even before the bonus is paid, the worker will not vary for any
slight reasons, if he positively knows at the time that he must
account for so doing, and that he will be considered to have
"stacked his judgment" against that of the manager. Being called to
account for deviations gives the man a feeling of responsibility
for his act, and also makes him feel his close relationship with
the managers.</p>
<p><b>No Set Time for Using Systems.</b> &mdash; There is, under
this type of management, no set time for the study of the
systems.</p>
<p><b>Systems Inelastic.</b> &mdash; Being written, these systems
have all the disadvantages of anything that is written. That is to
say, they require considerable adaptability <!--Page 215--><a name=
"P215" id="P215"></a> on the part of the man who is using them.
He must consider his own mind, and the amount of time which he must
put on studying; he must consider his own work, and adapting that
method to his work while still obeying instructions. In the case of
the system being in great detail, he can usually find a fairly
detailed description of what he is going to do, and can use that.
In the case of the system being not so complete, if his work
varies, he must show intelligence in varying the system, and this
intelligence often demands a knowledge which he has not, and knows
not where to obtain.</p>
<p><b>Waste of Time from Unstandardized Systems.</b> &mdash; The
time necessitated by the worker's laying out details of his method
is taken from the total time of his working day, hence in so far
cuts down his total product. Moreover, if no record is kept of the
details of his planning the next worker on the same kind of work
must repeat the investigation.</p>
<p><b>Later Transitional Management Emphasizes Use of
Standards.</b> &mdash; Later Transitional Management eliminates
this waste of time by standardizing methods composed of
standardized timed units, thus both rendering standards elastic,
and furnishing details.</p>
<p><b>Teaching Most Important Under Scientific Management.</b>
&mdash; Teaching is a most important element under Scientific
Management not only because it increases industrial efficiency, but
also because it fosters industrial peace. <a href=
"#ch08fn02"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Importance Depends on Other Elements of Scientific
<!--Page 216--><a name="P216" id="P216"></a> Management.</b>
&mdash; As we have seen, Scientific Management has as a basic idea
the necessity of divided responsibility, or functionalization.
This, when accompanied by the interdependent bonus, creates an
incentive to teach and an incentive to learn. Scientific Management
divides the planning from the performing in order to centralize and
standardize knowledge in the planning department, thus making all
knowledge of each available to all. This puts at the disposal of
all more than any could have alone. The importance of having this
collected and standardized knowledge conveyed best to the worker
cannot be overestimated. Through this knowledge, the worker is able
to increase his output, and thus insure the lowered costs, that
provide the funds with which to pay his higher wages, &mdash; to
increase his potential as well as actual efficiency, and best to
co&ouml;perate with other workers and with the management.</p>
<p><b>Importance of Teaching Element Best Claim to Permanence of
Scientific Management.</b> &mdash; Upon the emphasis which it
places on teaching rests/a large part of the claim of Scientific
Management for permanence. <a href="#ch08fn03"><sup>3</sup></a> We
have already shown the derivation of the standards which are
taught. We have shown that the relation between the planning and
performing departments is based largely on means and methods for
teaching. We have only to show here that the teaching is done in
accordance with those laws of Psychology that are the laws of
Pedagogy.</p>
<p><b>Teaching in Scientific Management Not the Result of Theory
Only.</b> &mdash; The methods of teaching under
<!--Page 217--><a name="P217" id="P217"></a> Scientific
Management were not devised in response to theories of education.
They are the result of actual experience in getting work done most
successfully. The teachers, the methods, the devices for teaching,
&mdash; all these grew up to meet needs, as did the other elements
of Scientific Management.</p>
<p><b>Conformity of Teaching to Psychological Laws Proof of Worth
of Scientific Management.</b> &mdash; The fact that teaching under
Scientific Management does conform, as will be shown, to the laws
of Psychology, is an added proof of the value of Scientific
Management.</p>
<p><b>Change from Teaching Under Traditional Management.</b>
&mdash; Mr. Gantt says, "The general policy of the past has been to
drive; but the era of force must give way to that of knowledge, and
the policy of the future will be to teach and to lead, to the
advantage of all concerned." <a href="#ch08fn04"><sup>4</sup></a>
This "driving" element of Traditional Management is eliminated by
Scientific Management.</p>
<p><b>Necessity for Personally Derived Judgment Eliminated.</b>
&mdash; So also is eliminated the old belief that the worker must
go through all possible experiences in order to acquire "judgment"
as to best methods. If the worker must pass through all the stages
of the training of the old-fashioned mechanic, and this is
seriously advocated by some, he may fail to reach the higher planes
of knowledge afforded by training under Scientific Management, by
reason of sheer lack of time. If, therefore, by artificial
conditions caused by united agreement and collective bargaining,
workmen insist upon forcing upon the new learners the
<!--Page 218--><a name="P218" id="P218"></a> old-school
training, they will lose just so much of the benefits of training
under those carefully arranged and carefully safe-guarded processes
of industrial investigation in which modern science has been
successful. To refuse to start in where others have left off, is
really as wasteful as it would be to refuse to use mathematical
formulas because they have been worked out by others. It might be
advocated that the mind would grow by working out every possible
mathematical formula before using it, but the result would be that
the student would be held back from any further original
investigation. Duplicating primary investigations might be original
work for him, but it would be worthless as far as the world is
concerned. The same is absolutely true in management. If the worker
is held back by acquiring every bit of knowledge for himself
instead of taking the work of others as the starting point, the
most valuable initiative will be lost to the world.</p>
<p><b>Bad Habits the Result of Undirected Learning.</b> &mdash;
Even worse than the waste of time would be the danger of acquiring
habits of bad methods, habits of unnecessary motions, habits of
inaccurate work; habits of inattention. Any or all of these might
develop. These are all prevented under Scientific Management by the
improved methods of teaching.</p>
<p><b>Valuable Elements of Traditional Management Conserved.</b>
&mdash; There are, however, many valuable elements of the old
Traditional system of teaching and of management which should be
retained and not be lost in the new.</p>
<p>For example, &mdash; the greatest single cause of making
<!--Page 219--><a name="P219" id="P219"></a> men capable under
the old plan was the foreman's unconscious ability to make his men
believe, before they started a task, that they could achieve
it.</p>
<p>It must not be thought that because of the aids to the teacher
under Scientific Management the old thought of personality is lost.
The old ability to convert a man to the belief that he could do a
thing, to inspire him with confidence in his foreman, with
confidence in himself, and a desire to do things, is by no means
lost, on the contrary it is carefully preserved under Scientific
Management.</p>
<p><b>Teaching of Transitory Management Supplemented.</b> &mdash;
In the transforming of Transitory into Scientific Management, we
note that the process is one of supplementing, not of discarding.
Written system, which is the distinguishing characteristic of
Transitory Management, is somewhat limited in its scope, but its
usefulness is by no means impaired.</p>
<p><b>Scope of Teaching Under Scientific Management.</b> &mdash;
Under Scientific Management teaching must cover</p>
<p>1. Teaching of right methods of doing work,</p>
<p>2. Teaching of right habits of doing the right methods.</p>
<p>The teacher must so impart the knowledge that judgment can be
acquired without the learner being obliged himself to experience
all the elements of the judgment.</p>
<p><b>Needs for Teaching Under Scientific Management.</b> &mdash;
The needs for this teaching have been stated, but may be
recapitulated here.</p>
<p>1. Worker may not observe his own mistakes.
<!--Page 220--><a name="P220" id="P220"></a></p>
<p>2. Worker has no opportunity under the old industrial conditions
to standardize his own methods.</p>
<p>3. Worker must know standard practice.</p>
<p>4. Waste can be eliminated by the teaching.</p>
<p>5. Right habits can be instilled.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Teaching Under Scientific Management.</b> &mdash;
The Methods of Teaching under Scientific Management are</p>
<p>1. Written, by means of</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) Instruction Cards telling <i>what</i> is to
be done and <i>how.</i></p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) Systems, explaining the <i>why.</i></p>
<p class="ltritem">(c) Drawings, charts, plans, photographs,
illustrating methods.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(d) Records made by the worker himself.</p>
<p>2. Oral, the teaching of the Functional Foremen.</p>
<p>3. Object-lessons:</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) Exhibits.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) Working models.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(c) Demonstrations by the Teacher.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(d) Demonstrations by the worker under
Supervision.</p>
<p><b>Worker a Source of These Methods.</b> &mdash; It should be
often stated that, ultimately, the elements of all methods
<!--Page 221--><a name="P221" id="P221"></a> are derived from a
study of workers, and that the worker should be enabled to realize
this. Only when he feels that he is a part of what is taught, and
that the teachers are a <i>means</i> of presenting to him the
underlying principles of his own experience, will the worker be
able to co&ouml;perate with all his energy.</p>
<p><b>Instruction Cards Are Directions.</b> &mdash; Instruction
Cards are direct instructions for each piece of work, giving, in
most concise form, closely defined description of standard practice
and directions as to how each element of the standardized task is
to be performed. The makers know that they must make their
directions clear ultimately, therefore they strive constantly for
clearness.</p>
<p><b>Instruction Cards Teach Directly and Indirectly.</b> &mdash;
These Instruction Cards not only teach the worker directly best to
do his work, but also teach him indirectly how to become a leader,
demonstrator, teacher and functional foreman. Study of them may
lead to an interest in, and a study of, elements, and to
preparation for becoming one of the planning department. The
excellent method of attack of the Instruction Card cannot fail to
have some good effect, even upon such workers as do not consciously
note it.<a href="#ch08fn05"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Systems Are Reasons and Explanations.</b> &mdash; "Systems"
or standing orders are collections of detailed reasons for, and
explanations of, the decisions embodied in the directions of the
Instruction Cards. There is a system showing the standard practice
of each kind of work.</p>
<!--Page 222--><a name="P222" id="P222"></a>
<p><b>They Enlist the Judgment of the Worker.</b> &mdash; Under
really successful management, it is realized that the worker is of
an inquiring mind, and that, unless this inquiring tendency of his
is recognized, and his curiosity is satisfied, he can never do his
best work. Unless the man knows why he is doing the thing, his
judgment will never re&euml;nforce his work. He may conform to the
method absolutely, but his work will not enlist his zeal unless he
knows just exactly why he is made to work in the particular manner
prescribed. This giving of the "why" to the worker through the
system, and thus allowing his reason to follow through all the
details, and his judgment to conform absolutely, should silence the
objections of those who claim that the worker becomes a machine,
and that he has no incentive to think at his work. On the contrary,
it will be seen that this method furnishes him with more viewpoints
from which he can consider his work.</p>
<p><b>Drawings, Charts, Plans and Photographs Means of Making
Directions Clearer.</b> &mdash; The Instruction Cards are
supplemented with drawings, charts, plans and stereoscopic and
timed motion photographs, &mdash; any or all, &mdash; in order to
make the directions of the Instruction Cards plainer.</p>
<p><b>Stereoscopic and Micro-Motion Study Photographs Particularly
Useful.</b> &mdash; Stereoscopic photographs are especially useful
in helping non-visualizers, and in presenting absolutely new work.
The value as an educator of stereoscopic and synthesized
micro-motion photographs of right methods is as yet but faintly
appreciated.</p>
<!--Page 223--><a name="P223" id="P223"></a>
<p>The "timed motion picture," or "micro-motion study photograph"
as it is called, consists of rapidly photographing workers in
action accompanied by a specially constructed chronometer that
shows such minute divisions of time that motion pictures taken at a
speed that will catch the most rapid of human motions without a
blur, will show a different time of day in each photograph. The
difference in the time in any two pictures gives the elapsed time
of the desired motion operation or time unit.</p>
<p><b>Self-Made Records Educative.</b> &mdash; The educative value
of the worker's making his own records has never been sufficiently
appreciated. Dr. Taylor insists upon this procedure wherever
possible.<a href="#ch08fn06"><sup>6</sup></a> Not only does the
worker learn from the actual marking in of the spaces reserved for
him, but also he learns to feel himself a part of the record making
division of the management. This proof of the "square deal," in
recording his output, and of the confidence in him, cannot fail to
enlist his co&ouml;peration.</p>
<p><b>Oral Instruction Comes from the Functional Foremen.</b>
&mdash; The Functional Foremen are teachers whose business it is to
explain, translate and supplement the various written instructions
when the worker either does not understand them, does not know how
to follow them, or makes a mistake in following them.</p>
<p><b>Oral Instruction Has Its Fitting Place Under Scientific
Management.</b> &mdash; Oral instruction under Scientific
Management has at least four advantages over such instruction under
Traditional Management.</p>
<!--Page 224--><a name="P224" id="P224"></a>
<p>1. The Instructor is capable of giving instruction.</p>
<p>2. The Instructor's specialty is giving instruction.</p>
<p>3. The instruction is a supplement to written instructions.</p>
<p>4. The instruction comes at the exact time that the learner
needs it.</p>
<p><b>Teacher, or Functional Foreman, Should Understand Psychology
and Pedagogy.</b> &mdash; The successful teacher must understand
the minds of his men, and must be able to present his information
in such a way that it will be grasped readily. Such knowledge of
psychology and pedagogy as he possesses he may acquire almost
unconsciously</p>
<p>1. from the teaching of others,</p>
<p>2. from his study of Instruction Cards and Systems,</p>
<p>3. from actual practice in teaching.</p>
<p>The advantages of a study of psychology itself, as it applies to
the field of teaching in general, and of teaching in the industries
in particular, are apparent. Such study must, in the future, become
more and more prevalent.</p>
<p><b>Advantage of Functional Foreman-Teacher Over Teacher in the
Schools.</b> &mdash; The Functional Foreman-teacher has an
advantage over the teacher in the school in that the gap between
him and those he teaches is not so great. He knows, because he
remembers, exactly how the worker must have his information
presented to him. This gap is narrowed by functionalizing the oral
teaching, by using it merely as a supplement to the written
teaching, and by supplementing it with object-lessons.</p>
<!--Page 225--><a name="P225" id="P225"></a>
<p><b>Teacher Must Have Practical Knowledge of the Trade He Is to
Teach.</b> &mdash; The teacher must have an intimate practical
knowledge of the art or trade that he is to teach. The most
profound knowledge of Psychology will never be a substitute for the
mastery of the trade, as a condition precedent to turning out the
best craftsmen. This is provided for by securing teachers from the
ranks of the workers.<a href="#ch08fn07"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><b>He Must Have a Thorough Knowledge of the Standards.</b>
&mdash; He must have more than the traditional knowledge of the
trade that he is to teach; he must have also the knowledge that
comes only from scientific investigation of his trade. This
knowledge is ready and at hand, in the standards of Scientific
Management that are available to all for study.</p>
<p><b>He Must Be Convinced of the Value of the Methods He
Teaches.</b> &mdash; The teacher must also have an intimate
acquaintance with the records of output of the method he is to
teach as compared with those of methods held in high esteem by the
believer in the old methods; for it is a law that no teacher can be
efficient in teaching any method in which he does not believe, any
more than a salesman can do his best work when he does not
implicitly believe in the goods that he is selling.</p>
<p><b>He Must Be an Enthusiast.</b> &mdash; The best teacher is the
one who is an enthusiast on the subject of the work itself, who can
cause contagion or imitation of his state of mind, by love of the
problems themselves.</p>
<p><b>Such Enthusiasm Contagious.</b> &mdash; It is the contagion
of this enthusiasm that will always create a demand
<!--Page 226--><a name="P226" id="P226"></a> for teachers, no
matter how perfect instruction cards may become. There is no form
or device of management that does away with good men, and in the
teacher, as here described, is conserved the personal element of
the successful, popular Traditional foreman.</p>
<p><b>Valuable Teacher Interests Men in the Economic Value of
Scientific Management.</b> &mdash; The most valuable teacher is one
who can arouse his pupils to such a state of interest in the
economic values of the methods of Scientific Management, that all
other objects that would ordinarily distract or hold their
attention will be banished from their minds. They will then
remember each step as it is introduced, and they will be consumed
with interest and curiosity to know what further steps can be
introduced, that will still further eliminate waste.</p>
<p><b>Object-lesson May Be "Working Models."</b> &mdash; The
object-lesson may be a "fixed exhibit" or a "working model," "a
process in different stages," or "a micro-motion study film" of the
work that is to be done. Successful and economical teaching may be
done with such models, which are especially valuable where the
workers do not speak the same language as the teacher, where many
workers are to perform exactly similar work, or where the memory,
the visualizing and the constructive imagination, are so poor that
the models must be referred to constantly. Models naturally appeal
best to those who take in information easiest through the eyes.</p>
<p><b>Object-lessons May Be Demonstrations by the
<!--Page 227--><a name="P227" id="P227"></a> Teacher.</b>
&mdash; The teacher may demonstrate the method manually to the
worker, or by means of films showing synthesized right methods on
the motion-picture screen. This, also, is a successful method of
teaching those who speak a different language, or of explaining new
work, &mdash; though it calls for a better memory than does the
"working model," The model, however, shows desired results; the
demonstration, desired methods.</p>
<p><b>Demonstration Method Chief Method of Teaching by Foremen.</b>
&mdash; The manual demonstration method is the chief method of
teaching the workmen by the foremen under Scientific Management,
and no method is rated as standard that cannot be successfully
demonstrated by the teacher, at any time, on request.</p>
<p><b>Worker may Demonstrate Under Supervision.</b> &mdash; If the
worker is of that type that can learn only by actually doing the
work himself, he is allowed to demonstrate the method under
supervision of the teacher. <a href=
"#ch08fn08"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Teaching Always Available Under Scientific Management.</b>
&mdash; Under Scientific Management all of these forms of teaching
are available constantly. The instruction card and accompanying
illustrations are given to the worker before he starts to work, and
are so placed that he can consult them easily at any time during
the work. As, also, if object-lessons are used, they are given
before work commences, and repeated when necessary.</p>
<!--Page 228--><a name="P228" id="P228"></a>
<p>The teacher is constantly available for oral instruction, and
the systems are constantly available for consultation.</p>
<p><b>Methods of Teaching Under Scientific Management
Psychologically Right.</b> &mdash; In order to prove that teaching
under Scientific Management is most valuable, it is necessary to
show that it is psychologically right, that it leads to mental
development and improvement. Under Scientific Management, teaching,
&mdash;</p>
<p>&ensp;1. uses and trains the senses.</p>
<p>&ensp;2. induces good habits of thinking and acting.</p>
<p>&ensp;3. stimulates attention,</p>
<p>&ensp;4. provides for valuable associations.</p>
<p>&ensp;5. assists and strengthens the memory.</p>
<p>&ensp;6. develops the imagination.</p>
<p>&ensp;7. develops judgment.</p>
<p>&ensp;8. utilizes suggestion.</p>
<p>&ensp;9. utilizes "native reactions."</p>
<p>10. develops the will.</p>
<p><b>Teaching Under Scientific Management Trains the Senses.</b>
&mdash; Scientific Management, in teaching the man, aims to train
all of his senses possible. Not only does each man show an aptitude
for some special sense training, <a href=
"#ch08fn09"><sup>9</sup></a> but at certain times one sense may be
stronger than another; for example, the sense of hearing, as is
illustrated by the saying, "The patient in the hospital knoweth
when his doctor cometh by the fall of his footsteps, yet when he
recovereth he knoweth not even his face." At the
<!--Page 229--><a name="P229" id="P229"></a> time that a certain
thing becomes of interest, and becomes particularly interesting to
one sense, that sense is particularly keen and developed.</p>
<p>Scientific Management cannot expect, without more detailed
psychological data than is as yet available, to utilize these
periods of sense predominance adequately. It can, and does, aim to
utilize such senses as are trained, and to supply defects of
training of the other senses.</p>
<p><b>Such Training Partially Determines the Quality of the
Work.</b> &mdash; The importance of sense training can scarcely be
overestimated. Through his senses, the worker takes in the
directions as to what he is to do, and on the accuracy with which
his senses record the impressions made upon them, depends the
mental model which he ultimately follows, and the accuracy of his
criticism of the resulting physical object of his work. Through the
senses, the worker sets his own task, and inspects his work.</p>
<p><b>Sense Training Influences Increase of Efficiency.</b> &mdash;
With the training of the senses the possibility of increased
efficiency increases. As any sense becomes trained, the minimum
visable is reduced, and more accurate impressions become
possible.<a href="#ch08fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> They lead to more
rapid work, by eliminating time necessary for judgment. The
bricklayer develops a fineness of touch that allows him to dispense
with sight in some parts of his work.</p>
<p><b>Selective Power of Senses Developed.</b> &mdash; James
defines the sense organs as "organs of selection." <a href=
"#ch08fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> <!--Page 230--><a name="P230" id=
"P230"></a> Scientific Management so trains them that they can
select what is of most value to the worker.</p>
<p><b>Methods of Sense Training Under Scientific Management.</b>
&mdash; The senses are trained under Scientific Management by means
of the various sources of teaching. The instruction card, with its
detailed descriptions of operations, and its accompanying
illustrations, not only tends to increase powers of visualization,
but also, by the close observation it demands, it reduces the
minimum visible. The "visible instruction card," or working model,
is an example of supplementing weak power of visualization. The
most available simple, inexpensive and easily handled device to
assist visualizing is the stereo or three-dimension photograph,
which not only serves its purpose at the time of its use, but
trains the eye to see the third dimension always.</p>
<p>Much training is given to the eye in Scientific Management by
the constant insistence on inspection. This inspection is not
confined to the inspector, but is the constant practice of worker
and foremen, in order that work may be of such a quality as will
merit a bonus.</p>
<p><b>Senses That Are Most Utilized Best Trained.</b> &mdash; The
relative training given to the various senses depends on the nature
of the work. When the ear is the tester of efficiency, as it often
is with an engineer watching machinery in action, emphasis is laid
on training the hearing. In work where touch is important, emphasis
is on such training as will develop that sense. <a href=
"#ch08fn12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<!--Page 231--><a name="P231" id="P231"></a>
<p><b>Variations in Sense Power Should Be Utilized.</b> &mdash;
Investigations are constantly going to prove that each sense has a
predominance at a different time in the age of the child or man.
Dottoressa Montessori's experience with teaching very young
children by touch shows that that sense is able to discriminate to
an extraordinary extent for the first six years of life. <a href=
"#ch08fn13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>So, also, acute keenness of any sense, by reason of age or
experience should be conserved. <a href=
"#ch08fn14"><sup>14</sup></a> Such acuteness is often the result of
some need, and, unless consciously preserved, will vanish with the
need.</p>
<p><b>Progress in Such Training.</b> &mdash; The elementary sense
experiences are defined and described by Calkins. <a href=
"#ch08fn15"><sup>15</sup></a> Only through a psychological study
can one realize the numerous elements and the possibility of study.
As yet, doubtless, Scientific Management misses many opportunities
for training and utilizing the senses. But the standardizing of
elements, and the realization of the importance of more and more
intensive study of the elements lends assurance that ultimately all
possibilities will be utilized.</p>
<p><b>As Many Senses as Possible Appealed To.</b> &mdash;
Scientific Management has made great progress in appealing to as
many senses as possible in its teaching. The importance of the
relation between the senses is brought out by Prof.
Stratton.<a href="#ch08fn16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>In teaching, Scientific Management has, in its
<!--Page 232--><a name="P232" id="P232"></a> teachers, animate
and inanimate, great possibilities of appealing to many senses
simultaneously. The instruction card may be</p>
<p>1. read to oneself silently &mdash; eyes appealed to</p>
<p>2. read to oneself aloud &mdash; eyes and ears appealed to, also
muscles used trained to repeat</p>
<p>3. read aloud to one &mdash; ears</p>
<p>4. read aloud to one and also read silently by one, &mdash; eyes
and ears</p>
<p>5. read aloud, and at the same time copied &mdash; eyes, ears,
muscles of mouth, muscles of hand</p>
<p>6. read to one, while process described is demonstrated</p>
<p>7. read to one while process is performed by oneself</p>
<p>There are only a few of the possible combinations, any of which
are used, as best suits the worker and the work. <a href=
"#ch08fn17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Untrained Worker Requires Appeal to Most Senses.</b> &mdash;
The value of appeal to many senses is best realized in teaching an
inexperienced worker. His senses help to remind him what to do, and
to "check up" his results.</p>
<p><b>At Times Appeal to But One Sense Preferable. &mdash;</b> In
the case of work that must be watched constantly, and that involves
continuous processes, it may prove best to have directions read to
the worker. So also, the Gang Instruction Card may often be read to
advantage to the gang, thus allowing the next member of a group of
members to rest, or to observe, while directions are taken in
through the ears only. In this <!--Page 233--><a name="P233" id=
"P233"></a> way time is allowed to overcome fatigue, yet the
work is not halted.</p>
<p><b>At Times One Sense Is Best Not Utilized.</b> &mdash; At times
teaching may well omit one sense in its appeal, because that sense
will tend to confuse the learning, and will, when the method is
learned, be otherwise utilized than it could be during the learning
process. In teaching the "touch system" of typewriting, <a href=
"#ch08fn18"><sup>18</sup></a> the position of the keys is quickly
remembered by having the key named aloud and at the same time
struck with the assigned finger, the eyes being blindfolded. Thus
hearing is utilized, also mouth muscles and finger muscles, but
<i>not</i> sight.</p>
<p><b>Importance of Fatigue Recognized.</b> &mdash; A large part of
the success of sense appeal and sense training of Scientific
Management is in the appreciation of the importance of fatigue.
This was early recognized by Dr. Taylor, and is constantly
receiving study from all those interested in Scientific
Management.</p>
<p><b>Psychology Already Aiding the Industries in Such Study.</b>
&mdash; Study of the <i>Psychological Review</i> will demonstrate
the deep and increasing interest of psychologists in the subject of
fatigue. The importance of such stimulating and helpful work as
that done by Doctor A. Imbert of the University of Montpellier,
France, is great.<a href="#ch08fn19"><sup>19</sup></a> Not only are
the results of his investigations commercially valuable, but also
they are valuable as indicating the close connection between
Psychology and Industrial Efficiency.</p>
<!--Page 234--><a name="P234" id="P234"></a>
<p><b>Importance of Habits. <a href=
"#ch08fn20"><sup>20</sup></a></b> &mdash; Prof. William James says
"an acquired habit, from the psychological point of view, is
nothing but a new pathway of discharge formed in the brain, by
which certain incoming currents ever after tend to escape."</p>
<p>And again, &mdash; "First, habit simplifies our movements, makes
them accurate, and diminishes fatigue," <a href=
"#ch08fn21"><sup>21</sup></a> and habit diminishes the conscious
attention with which our acts are performed. Again he says, page
144, "The great thing, then, in all education, is to make our
nervous system our ally instead of an enemy; as it is to fund and
capitalize our acquisitions, and live at ease upon the interest of
the fund. For this we must make automatic and habitual, as early as
possible, as many useful actions as we can, and guard against the
growing into ways that are likely to be disadvantageous to us, as
we should guard against the plague."</p>
<p>These quotations demonstrate the importance of habit.</p>
<p>How deep these paths of discharge are, is illustrated by the
fact that often a German, having spent the early years of his
school life in Germany, will, even after learning to speak, read,
write and think in English, find it difficult to figure in anything
but German.</p>
<p><b>Habit Easily Becomes the Master.</b> &mdash; Another
illustration of the power of habit is exhibited by the bricklayer,
who has been trained under old-time methods,
<!--Page 235--><a name="P235" id="P235"></a> and who attempts to
follow the packet method. The standard motions for picking up the
upper row of bricks from the packet are entirely different from
those for picking up the lower row. The bricklayers were taught
this, yet invariably used the old-time motions for picking up the
bricks, in spite of the waste involved. <a href=
"#ch08fn22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Wrong Preconceived Ideas Hamper Development.</b> &mdash;
Wrong habits or ideas often retard development. For example, it
took centuries for artists to see the colors of shadows correctly,
because they were sure that such shadows were a darker tone of the
color itself.<a href="#ch08fn23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Teaching Under Scientific Management Results in Good
Habits.</b> &mdash; The aim of teaching under Scientific
Management, as has been said, is to create good habits of thinking
and good habits of doing.</p>
<p><b>Standards Lead to Right Methods of Thinking and Acting.</b>
&mdash; The standards of Scientific Management, as presented to the
worker in the instruction card, lead to good habits, in that they
present the best known method of doing the work. They thus aid the
beginner, in that he need waste no time searching for right
methods, but can acquire right habits at once. They aid the worker
trained under an older, supplanted method, in that they wage a
winning war against old-time, worn-out methods and traditions. Old
motor images, which tend to cause motions, are overcome by standard
images, which suggest, and pass into, standard motions. The
spontaneous recurring <!--Page 236--><a name="P236" id=
"P236"></a> of images under the old method is the familiar cause
of inattention and being unable to get down to business, and the
real cause of the expression, "You can't teach old dogs new
tricks." On the other hand, the spontaneous recurrence of the
images of the standard method is the cause of greater speed of
movement of the experienced man, and these images of the standard
methods do recur often enough to drive down the old images and to
enable all men who desire, to settle down and concentrate upon what
they are doing.</p>
<p><b>Through Standards Bad Habits Are Quickest Broken.</b> &mdash;
Through the standards the bad habit is broken by the abrupt
acquisition of a new habit. This is at once practiced, is practiced
without exception, and is continually practiced until the new habit
is in control.<a href="#ch08fn24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Through Standards New Habits Are Quickest Formed.</b> &mdash;
These same standards, as presented in teaching, allow of the
speediest forming of habits, in that repetition is exact and
frequent, and is kept so by the fact that the worker's judgment
seconds that of the teacher.</p>
<p><b>Habits Are Instilled by Teaching.</b> &mdash; The chief
function of the teacher during the stage that habits are being
formed is the instilling of good habits.</p>
<p><b>Methods of Instilling Good Habits.</b> &mdash; This he does
by insisting on</p>
<p>1. right motions first, that is to say, &mdash; the right number
of right motions in the right sequence. <!--Page 237--><a name=
"P237" id="P237"></a></p>
<p>2. speed of motions second, that is to say, constantly
increasing speed.</p>
<p>3. constantly improving quality. <a href=
"#ch08fn25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p><b>This Method Is Contrary to Most Old-time Practice.</b>
&mdash; Under most old-time practice the quality of the work was
the first consideration, the quantity of work the second, and the
methods of achieving the results the third.</p>
<p><b>Results of Old-time Practice.</b> &mdash; As a result, the
mechanical reactions, which were expected constantly to follow the
improved habits of work, were constantly hindered by an involuntary
impulse of the muscles to follow the old methods. Waste time and
low output followed.</p>
<p><b>Some Early Recognition of "Right Motions First."</b> &mdash;
The necessity of teaching the right motions first was early
recognized by a few progressive spirits, as is shown in military
tactics; for example, see pages 6 and 7, "Cavalry Tactics of
U.S.A." 1879, D. Appleton, also page 51.</p>
<p>Note also motions for grooming the horse, page 473. These
directions not only teach the man how, but accustoms the horse to
the sequence and location of motions that he may expect.</p>
<p><b>Benefits of Teaching Right Motions First.</b> &mdash; Through
teaching right motions first reactions to stimuli gain in speed.
The right habit is formed at the outset. With the constant
insistence on these right habits that result from right motions,
will come, naturally, an increase in speed, which should be
fostered until the desired ultimate speed is reached.</p>
<!--Page 238--><a name="P238" id="P238"></a>
<p><b>Ultimately, Standard Quality Will Result.</b> &mdash; The
result of absolute insistence on right motions will be prescribed
quality, because the standard motions prescribed were chosen
because they best produced the desired result.</p>
<p><b>Under Scientific Management No Loss from Quality During
Learning.</b> &mdash; As will be shown later, Scientific Management
provides that there shall be little or no loss from the quality of
the work during the learning period. The delay in time before the
learner can be said to produce such work as could a learner taught
where quality was insisted upon first of all, is more than
compensated for by the ultimate combination of speed and quality
gained.</p>
<p><b>Results of Teaching the Right Motions First Are
Far-reaching.</b> &mdash; There is no more important subject in
this book on the Psychology of Management than this of teaching
right motions first. The most important results of Scientific
Management can all, in the last analysis, be formulated in terms of
habits, even to the underlying spirit of co&ouml;peration which, as
we shall show in "Welfare," is one of the most important ideas of
Scientific Management. These right habits of Scientific Management
are the cause, as well as the result, of progress, and the right
habits, which have such a tremendous psychological importance, are
the result of insisting that right motions be used from the very
beginning of the first day.</p>
<p><b>From Right Habits of Motion Comes Speed of Motions.
&mdash;</b> Concentrating the mind on the next motion causes speed
of motion. Under Scientific Management, the underlying thought of
sequence of motions <!--Page 239--><a name="P239" id="P239"></a>
is so presented that the worker can remember them, and make them in
the shortest time possible.</p>
<p><b>Response to Standards Becomes Almost Automatic.</b> &mdash;
The standard methods, being associated from the start with right
habits of motions only, cause an almost automatic response. There
are no discarded habits to delay response.</p>
<p><b>Steady Nerves Result.</b> &mdash; Oftentimes the power to
refrain from action is quite as much a sign of education and
training as the power to react quickly from a sensation. Such
conduct is called, in some cases, "steady nerves." The forming of
right habits is a great aid toward these steady nerves. The man who
knows that he is taught the right way, is able almost automatically
to resist any suggestions which come to him to carry out wrong
ways. So the man who is absolutely sure of his method, for example,
in laying brick, will not be tempted to make those extra motions
which, after all, are merely an exhibition in his hand of the
vacillation that is going on in his brain, as to whether he really
is handling that brick in exactly the most efficient manner, or
not.</p>
<p><b>Reason and Will Are Educated.</b> &mdash; "The education of
hand and muscle implies a corresponding training of reasoning and
will; and the co&ouml;rdination of movements accompanies the
co&ouml;rdination of thoughts." <a href=
"#ch08fn26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The standards of Scientific Management educate hand and muscle;
the education of hand and muscle train the mind; the mind improves
the standards. Thus we have a continuous cycle.</p>
<!--Page 240--><a name="P240" id="P240"></a>
<p><b>Judgment Results with No Waste of Time.</b> &mdash; Judgment
is the outcome of learning the right way, and knowing that it is
the right way. There is none of the lost time of "trying out"
various methods that exists under Traditional Management.</p>
<p>This power of judgment will not only enable the possessor to
decide correctly as to the relative merits of different methods,
but also somewhat as to the past history and possibilities of
different workers.</p>
<p>This, again, illustrates the wisdom of Scientific Management in
promoting from the ranks, and thus providing that every member of
the organization shall, ultimately, know from experience how to
estimate and judge the work of others.</p>
<p><b>Habits of Attention Formed by Scientific Management.</b>
&mdash; The good habits which result from teaching standard methods
result in habits of attention. The standards aid the mind in
holding a "selective attitude," <a href=
"#ch08fn27"><sup>27</sup></a> by presenting events in an orderly
sequence. The conditions under which the work is done, and the
incentives for doing it, provide that the attention shall be
"lively and prolonged."</p>
<p><b>Prescribed Motions Afford Rhythm and &AElig;sthetic
Pleasure.</b> &mdash; The prescribed motions that result from
motion study and time study, and that are arranged in cycles,
afford a rhythm that allows the attention to "glide over some beats
and linger on others," as Prof. Stratton describes it, in a
different connection.<a href="#ch08fn28"><sup>28</sup></a> So also
the "perfectly controlled" movements, which fall under the
direction of a guiding law, and <!--Page 241--><a name="P241" id=
"P241"></a> which "obey the will absolutely,"<a href=
"#ch08fn29"><sup>29</sup></a> give an &aelig;sthetic pleasure and
afford less of a tax upon the attention.</p>
<p><b>Instruction Card Creates and Holds Attention.</b> &mdash; As
has been already said in describing the instruction card under
Standardization, it was designed as a result of investigations as
to what would best secure output, &mdash; to attract and hold the
attention.<a href="#ch08fn30"><sup>30</sup></a> Providing, as it
does, all directions that an experienced worker is likely to need,
he can confine his attention solely to his work and his card;
usually, after the card is once studied, to his work alone. The
close relation of the elements of the instruction card affords a
field for attention to lapse, and be recalled in the new elements
that are constantly made apparent.</p>
<p><b>Oral Individual Teaching Fosters Concentrated Attention.</b>
&mdash; The fact that under Scientific Management oral teaching is
individual, not only directly concentrates the attention of the
learner upon what he is being taught, but also indirectly prevents
distraction from fear of ridicule of others over the question, or
embarrassment in talking before a crowd.</p>
<p><b>The Bulletin Board Furnishes the Element of Change.</b>
&mdash; In order that interest or attention may be held, there must
be provision for allied subjects on which the mind is to wander.
This, under Scientific Management, is constantly furnished by the
collection of jobs ahead on the bulletin board. The tasks piled up
ahead upon this bulletin board provide a needed and ready change
for the subject of attention <!--Page 242--><a name="P242" id=
"P242"></a> or interest, which conserves the economic value of
concentrated attention of the worker upon his work. Such future
tasks furnish sufficient range of subject for wandering attention
to rest the mind from the wearying effect of overconcentration or
forced attention. The assigned task of the future systematizes the
"stream of attention," and an orderly scheme of habits of thought
is installed. When the scheme is an orderly shifting of attention,
the mind is doing its best work, for, while the standardized
extreme subdivision of Taylor's plan, the comparison of the
ultimate unit, and groupings of units of future tasks are often
helps in achieving the present tasks, without such a definite
orderly scheme for shifting the attention and interest, the
attention will shift to useless subjects, and the result will be
scattered.</p>
<p><b>Incentives Maintain Interest.</b> &mdash; The knowledge that
a prompt reward will follow success stimulates interest. The
knowledge that this reward is sure concentrates attention and thus
maintains interest.</p>
<p>In the same way, the assurance of promotion, and the fact that
the worker sees those of his own trade promoted, and knows it is to
the advantage of the management, as well as to his advantage, that
he also be promoted, &mdash; this also maintains interest in the
work.</p>
<p><b>This Interest Extends to the Work of Others.</b> &mdash; The
interest is extended to the work of others, not only by the
interrelated bonuses, but also by the fact that every man is
expected to train up a man to take his place, before he is
promoted.</p>
<p><b>Close Relationship of All Parts of Scientific Management
<!--Page 243--><a name="P243" id="P243"></a> Holds Interest.</b>
&mdash; The attention of the entire organization, as well as of the
individual worker, is held by Scientific Management and its
teaching, because all parts of Scientific Management are related,
and because Scientific Management provides for scientifically
directed progression. Every member of the organization knows that
the standards which are taught by Scientific Management contain the
permanent elements of past successes, and provide for such
development as will assure progress and success in the future.
Every member of the organization realizes that upon his individual
co&ouml;peration depends, in part, the stability of Scientific
Management, because it is based on universal co&ouml;peration. This
provides an intensity and a continuity of interest that would still
hold, even though some particular element might lose its
interest.</p>
<p><b>This Relationship Also Provides for Associations.</b> &mdash;
The close relationship of all parts of Scientific Management
provides that all ideas are associated, and are so closely
connected that they can act as a single group, or any selected
number of elements can act as a group.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Establishes Brain Groups That
Habitually Act in Unison.</b> &mdash; Professor Read, in describing
the general mental principle of association says, "When any number
of brain cells have been in action together, they form a habit of
acting in unison, so that when one of them is stimulated in a
certain way, the others will also behave in the way established by
the habit."<a href="#ch08fn31"><sup>31</sup></a> This working of
the brain is <!--Page 244--><a name="P244" id="P244"></a>
recognized in grouping of motions, such as "playing for position."
<a href="#ch08fn32"><sup>32</sup></a> Scientific Management
provides the groups, the habit, and the stimulus, all according to
standard methods, so that the result is largely predictable.</p>
<p><b>Method of Establishing Such Groups in the Worker's Brain.</b>
&mdash; The standard elements of Scientific Management afford units
for such groups. Eventually, with the use of such elements in
instruction cards, would be formed, in the minds of the worker,
such groups of units as would aid in foreseeing results, just as
the foreseeing of groups of moves aids the expert chess or checker
player. The size and number of such groups would indicate the skill
of the worker.</p>
<p>That such skill may be gained quickest, Scientific Management
synthesizes the units into definite groups, and teaches these to
the workers as groups.</p>
<p><b>Teaching Done by Means of Motion Cycles.</b> &mdash; The best
group is that which completes the simplest cycle of performance.
This enables the worker to associate certain definite motions, to
make these into a habit, and to concentrate his attention upon the
cycle as a whole, and not upon the elementary motions of which it
is composed.</p>
<p>For example &mdash; The cycle of the pick and dip process of
bricklaying is to pick up a brick and a trowel full of mortar
simultaneously and deposit them on the wall simultaneously.
<a href="#ch08fn33"><sup>33</sup></a> The string mortar method
<!--Page 245--><a name="P245" id="P245"></a> has two cycles,
which are, first to pick a certain number of trowelfuls of mortar
and deposit them on the wall, and then to pick up a corresponding
number of bricks and deposit them on the wall. <a href=
"#ch08fn34"><sup>34</sup></a> Each cycle of these two methods
consists of an association of units that can be remembered as a
group.</p>
<p><b>Such Cycles Induce Speed.</b> &mdash; The worker who has been
taught thus to associate the units of attention and action into
definite rhythmic cycles, is the one who is most efficient, and
least fatigued by a given output. The nerves acquire the habit, as
does the brain, and the resulting swift response to stimulus
characterizes the efficiency of the specialist. <a href=
"#ch08fn35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Restricts Associations.</b> &mdash; By
its teaching of standard methods, Scientific Management restricts
association, and thus gains in the speed with which associated
ideas arise.<a href="#ch08fn36"><sup>36</sup></a> Insistence on
causal sequence is a great aid. This is rendered by the Systems,
which give the reasons, and make the standard method easy to
remember.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Presents Scientifically Derived
Knowledge to the Memory.</b> &mdash; Industrial memory is founded
on experience, and that experience that is submitted by teaching
under Scientific Management to the mind is in the form of
scientifically derived standards. These furnish</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) data that is correct.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) images that are an aid in acquiring new
habits of forming efficient images. <!--Page 246--><a name="P246"
id="P246"></a></p>
<p class="ltritem">(c) standards of comparison, and constant
demands for comparison.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(d) such arrangement of elements that reasoning
processes are stimulated.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(e) conscious, efficient grouping.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(f) logical association of ideas.</p>
<p><b>Provision for Repetition of Important Ideas. &mdash;</b>
Professor Ebbinghaur says, "Associations that have equal
reproductive power lapse the more slowly, the older they are, and
the oftener they have been reviewed by renewed memorizing."
Scientific Management provides for utilizing this law by teaching
right motions first, and by so minutely dividing the elements of
such motions that the smallest units discovered are found
frequently, in similar and different operations.</p>
<p><b>Best Periods for Memorizing Utilized.</b> &mdash; As for
education of the memory, there is a wide difference of opinion
among leading psychologists in regard to whether or not the
memorizing faculty, as the whole, can be improved by training; but
all agree that those things which are specially desired to be
memorized can be learned more easily, and more quickly, under some
conditions than under others:</p>
<p>For example, there is a certain time of day, for each person,
when the memory is more efficient than at other times. This is
usually in the morning, but is not always so. The period when
memorizing is easiest is taken advantage of, and, as far as
possible, new methods and new instruction cards are passed out at
that time when the worker is naturally best fitted to remember what
is to be done.</p>
<p><b>Individual Differences Respected.</b> &mdash; It is a
question <!--Page 247--><a name="P247" id="P247"></a> that
varies with different conditions, whether the several instruction
cards beyond the one he is working on shall be given to the worker
ahead of time, that he may use his own judgment as to when is the
best time to learn, or whether he shall have but one at a time, and
concentrate on that. For certain dispositions, it is a great help
to see a long line of work ahead. They enjoy getting the work done,
and feeling that they are more or less ahead of record. Others
become confused if they see too much ahead, and would rather attack
but one problem at a time. This fundamental difference in types of
mind should be taken advantage of when laying out material to be
memorized.</p>
<p><b>Aid of Mnemonic Symbols to the Memory.</b> &mdash; The
mnemonic classifications furnish a place where the worker who
remembers but little of a method or process can go, and recover the
full knowledge of that which he has forgotten. Better still, they
furnish him the equivalent of memory of other experiences that he
has never had, and that are in such form that he can connect this
with his memory of his own personal experience.</p>
<p>The ease with which a learner or skilled mechanic can associate
new, scientifically derived data with his memory, because of the
classifications of Scientific Management, is a most important cause
of workers being taught quicker, and being more intelligent, under
Scientific Management, than under any other type of management.</p>
<p><b>Proper Learning Insures Proper Remembering.</b> &mdash;
Professor Read says, "Take care of the learning and
<!--Page 248--><a name="P248" id="P248"></a> the remembering
will take care of itself." <a href="#ch08fn37"><sup>37</sup></a>
Scientific Management both provides proper knowledge, and provides
that this shall be utilized in such a manner that proper
remembering will ensue.</p>
<p><b>Better Habits of Remembering Result.</b> &mdash; The results
of cultivating the memory under Scientific Management are
cumulative. Ultimately, right habits of remembering result that aid
the worker automatically so to arrange his memory material as to
utilize it better.<a href="#ch08fn38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p><b>"Imagination" Has Two Definitions.</b> &mdash; Professor Read
gives definitions for two distinct means of Imagination.</p>
<p>1. "The general function of the having of images."</p>
<p>2. "The particular one of having images which are not
consciously memories or the reproduction of the facts of experience
as they were originally presented to consciousness." <a href=
"#ch08fn39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Provides Material for Images.</b>
&mdash; As was shown under the discussion of the appeals of the
various teaching devices of Scientific Management, &mdash;
provision is made for the four classes of imagination of
Calkins<a href="#ch08fn40"><sup>40</sup></a> &mdash;</p>
<p>1. visual,</p>
<p>2. auditory,</p>
<p>3. tactual, and</p>
<p>4. mixed.</p>
<!--Page 249--><a name="P249" id="P249"></a>
<p><b>It Also Realizes the Importance of Productive
Imagination.</b> &mdash; Scientific Management realizes that one of
the special functions of teaching the trades is systematic
exercising and guiding of imaginations of apprentices and learners.
As Professor Ennis says, &mdash; "Any kind of planning ahead will
result in some good," but to plan ahead most effectively it is
necessary to have a well-developed power of constructive
imagination. This consists of being able to construct new mental
images from old memory images; of being able to modify and group
images of past experiences, or thoughts, in combination with new
images based on imagination, and not on experience. The excellence
of the image arrived at in the complete work is dependent wholly
upon the training in image forming in the past. If there has not
been a complete economic system of forming standard habits of
thought, the worker may have difficulty in controlling the trend of
associations of thought images, and difficulty in adding entirely
new images to the groups of experienced images, and the problem to
be thought out will suffer from wandering of the mind. The result
will be more like a dream than a well balanced mental planning. It
is well known that those apprentices, and journeymen as well, are
the quickest to learn, and are better learners, who have the most
vivid imagination. The best method of teaching the trade,
therefore, is the one that also develops the power of
imagination.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Assists Productive Imagination.</b>
&mdash; Scientific Management assists productive, or constructive,
imagination, not only by providing <!--Page 250--><a name="P250"
id="P250"></a> standard units, or images, from which the results
may, be synthesized, but also, through the unity of the instruction
card, allows of imagination of the outcome, from the start.</p>
<p>For example, &mdash; in performing a prescribed cycle of
motions, the worker has his memory images grouped in such a figure,
form, or sequence, &mdash; often geometrical, &mdash; that each
motion is a part of a growing, clearly imagined whole.</p>
<p>The elements of the cycle may be utilized in other entirely new
cycles, and are, as provided for in the opportunities for invention
that are a part of Scientific Management.</p>
<p><b>Judgment the Result of Faithful Endeavor.</b> &mdash;
Judgment, or the "mental process which ends in an affirmation or
negation of something," <a href="#ch08fn41"><sup>41</sup></a> comes
as the result of experience, as is admirably expressed by Prof.
James, &mdash; "Let no youth have any anxiety about the upshot of
his education whatever the line of it may be. If he keeps
faithfully busy each hour of the working day, he may safely leave
the final result to itself. He can with perfect certainty count on
waking up some fine morning, to find himself one of the competent
ones of his generation, in whatever pursuit he may have singled
out. Silently, between all the details of his business, the
<i>power of judging</i> in all that class of matter will have built
itself up within him as a possession that will never pass away.
Young people should know this truth in advance. <a href=
"#ch08fn42"><sup>42</sup></a> The ignorance of it has probably
engendered more discouragement <!--Page 251--><a name="P251" id=
"P251"></a> and faint-heartedness in youths embarking on arduous
careers than all other causes put together." <a href=
"#ch08fn43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Teaching Supplies This Judgment Under Scientific
Management.</b> &mdash; Under Scientific Management this judgment
is the result of teaching of standards that are recognized as such
by the learner. Thus, much time is eliminated, and the apprentice
under Scientific Management can work with all the assurance as to
the value of his methods that characterized the seasoned veterans
of older types of management.</p>
<p><b>Teaching Also Utilizes the Judgment.</b> &mdash; The judgment
that is supplied by Scientific Management is also used as a spring
toward action.<a href="#ch08fn44"><sup>44</sup></a> Scientific
Management appeals to the reason, and workers perform work as they
do because, through the Systems and otherwise, they are persuaded
that the method they employ is the best.</p>
<p><b>The Power of Suggestion Is Also Utilized.</b> <a href=
"#ch08fn45"><sup>45</sup></a> &mdash; The dynamic power of ideas is
recognized by Scientific Management, in that the instruction card
is put in the form of direct commands, which, naturally, lead to
immediate action. So, also, the teaching written, oral and object,
as such, can be directly imitated by the learner. <a href=
"#ch08fn46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Imitation, which Dr. Stratton says "may well be counted a
special form of suggestion," will be discussed later in this
chapter at length.<a href="#ch08fn47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<!--Page 252--><a name="P252" id="P252"></a>
<p><b>Worker Always Has Opportunity to Criticise the
Suggestion.</b> &mdash; The worker is expected to follow the
suggestion of Scientific Management without delay, because he
believes in the standardization on which it is made, and in the
management that makes it. But the Systems afford him an opportunity
of reviewing the reasonableness of the suggestion at any time, and
his constructive criticism is invited and rewarded.</p>
<p><b>Suggestion Must Be Followed at the Time.</b> &mdash; The
suggestion must be followed at the time it is given, or its value
as a suggestion is impaired. This is provided for by the underlying
idea of co&ouml;peration on which Scientific Management rests,
which molds the mental attitude of the worker into that form where
suggestions are quickest grasped and followed. <a href=
"#ch08fn48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p><b>"Native Reactions" Enumerated by Prof. James.</b> &mdash;
Prof. James enumerates the "native reactions" as (1) fear, (2)
love, (3) curiosity, (4) imitation, (5) emulation, (6) ambition,
(7) pugnacity, (8) pride, (9) ownership, (10)
constructiveness.<a href="#ch08fn49"><sup>49</sup></a> These are
all considered by Scientific Management. Such as might have a
harmful effect are supplanted, others are utilized.</p>
<p><b>Fear Utilized by Ancient Managers.</b> &mdash; The native
reaction most utilized by the first managers of armies and ancient
works of construction was that of fear. This is shown by the
ancient rock carvings, which portray what happened to those who
disobeyed.<a href="#ch08fn50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<!--Page 253--><a name="P253" id="P253"></a>
<p><b>Fear Still Used by Traditional Management.</b> &mdash; Fear
of personal bodily injury is not usual under modern Traditional
Management, but fear of less progress, less promotion, less
remuneration, or of discharge, or of other penalties for inferior
effort or efficiency is still prevalent.</p>
<p><b>Fear Transformed Under Scientific Management.</b> &mdash;
Under Scientific Management the worker may still fear that he will
incur a penalty, or fail to deserve a reward, but the honest,
industrious worker experiences no such horror as the old-time fear
included. This is removed by his knowledge</p>
<p>1. that his task is achievable.</p>
<p>2. that his work will not injure his health.</p>
<p>3. that he may be sure of advancement with age and
experience.</p>
<p>4. that he is sure of the "square deal."</p>
<p>Thus such fear as he has, has a good and not an evil effect upon
him. It is an incentive to co&ouml;perate willingly. Its immediate
and ultimate effects are advantageous.</p>
<p><b>Love, or Loyalty, Fostered by Scientific Management.</b>
&mdash; The worker's knowledge that the management plans to
maintain such conditions as will enable him to have the four
assurances enumerated above leads to love, or loyalty, between
workers and employers.<a href="#ch08fn51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Far from Scientific Management abolishing the old personal and
sympathetic relations between employers and workers, it gives
opportunities for such <!--Page 254--><a name="P254" id=
"P254"></a> relations as have not existed since the days of the
guilds, and the old apprenticeship. <a href=
"#ch08fn52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>The co&ouml;peration upon which Scientific Management rests does
away with the traditional "warfare" between employer and workers
that made permanent friendliness almost impossible.
Co&ouml;peration induces friendliness and loyalty of each member in
the organization to all the others.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilfred Lewis says, in describing the installation of
Scientific Management in his plant, "We had, in effect, been
installing at great expense a new and wonderful means for
increasing the efficiency of labor, in the benefits of which the
workman himself shared, and we have today an organization second, I
believe, to none in its loyalty, efficiency and steadfastness of
purpose."<a href="#ch08fn53"><sup>53</sup></a> This same loyalty of
the workers is plain in an article in <i>Industrial
Engineering</i>, on "Scientific Management as Viewed from the
Workman's Standpoint," where various men in a shop having
Scientific Management were interviewed.<a href=
"#ch08fn54"><sup>54</sup></a> After quoting various workers'
opinions of Scientific Management and their own particular shop,
the writer says: "Conversations with other men brought out
practically the same facts. They are all contented. They took pride
in their work, and seemed to be especially proud of the fact that
they were employed in the Link-Belt shops." <a href=
"#ch08fn55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<!--Page 255--><a name="P255" id="P255"></a>
<p><b>Teaching Under Scientific Management Develops Such
Loyalty.</b> &mdash; The manner of teaching under Scientific
Management fosters such loyalty. Only through friendly aid can both
teacher and taught prosper. Also, the perfection of the actual
workings of this plan of management inspires regard as well as
respect for the employer.</p>
<p><b>Value of Personality Not Eliminated.</b> &mdash; It is a
great mistake to think that Scientific Management underestimates
the value of personality. <a href="#ch08fn56"><sup>56</sup></a>
Rather, Scientific Management enhances the value of an admirable
personality. This is well exemplified in the Link-Belt Co.,
<a href="#ch08fn57"><sup>57</sup></a> and in the Tabor
Manufacturing Co. of Philadelphia, as well as on other work where
Scientific Management has been installed a period of several
years.</p>
<p><b>Curiosity Aroused by Scientific Management.</b> &mdash;
Scientific Management arouses the curiosity of the worker, by
showing, through its teaching, glimpses of the possibilities that
exist for further scientific investigation. The insistence on
standard methods of less waste arouses a curiosity as to whether
still less wasteful methods cannot be found.</p>
<p><b>Curiosity Utilized by Scientific Management.</b> &mdash; This
curiosity is very useful as a trait of the learner, the planner and
the investigator. It can be well utilized by the teacher who
recognizes it in the learner, by an adaptation of methods of
interpreting the instruction card, that will allow of partially
satisfying, <!--Page 256--><a name="P256" id="P256"></a> and at
the same time further exciting, the curiosity.</p>
<p>In selecting men for higher positions, and for special work,
curiosity as to the work, with the interest that is its result, may
serve as an admirable indication of one sort of fitness. This
curiosity, or general interest, is usually associated with a
personal interest that makes it more intense, and more easy to
utilize.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Places a High Value on Imitation.</b>
&mdash; It was a popular custom of the past to look down with scorn
on the individual or organization that imitated others. Scientific
Management believes that to imitate with great precision the best,
is a work of high intelligence and industrial efficiency.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Uses Both Spontaneous and Deliberate
Imitation.</b> &mdash; Teaching under Scientific Management induces
both spontaneous and deliberate imitation. The standardization
prevalent, and the conformity to standards exacted, provide that
this imitation shall follow directed lines.</p>
<p><b>Spontaneous Imitation Under Scientific Management Has
Valuable Results.</b> &mdash; Under Scientific Management, the
worker will spontaneously imitate the teacher, when the latter has
been demonstrating. This leads to desired results. So, also, the
worker imitates, more or less spontaneously, his own past methods
of doing work. The right habits early formed by Scientific
Management insure that the results of such imitation shall be
profitable.</p>
<p><b>Deliberate Imitation Constantly Encouraged.</b> &mdash;
Deliberate imitation is caused more than anything
<!--Page 257--><a name="P257" id="P257"></a> else by the fact
that the man knows, if he does the thing in the way directed, his
pay will be increased.</p>
<p>Such imitation is also encouraged by the fact that the worker is
made to believe that he is capable, and has the will to overcome
obstacles. He knows that the management believes he can do the
work, or the instruction card would not have been issued to him.
Moreover, he sees that the teacher and demonstrator is a man
promoted from his rank, and he is convinced, therefore, that what
the teacher can do he also can do. <a href=
"#ch08fn58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Provides Standards for Imitation.</b>
&mdash; It is of immense value in obtaining valuable results from
imitation, that Scientific Management provides standards. Under
Traditional Management, it was almost impossible for a worker to
decide which man he should imitate. Even though he might come to
determine, by constant observation, after a time, which man he
desired to imitate, he would not know in how far he would do well
to copy any particular method. Recording individually measured
output under Transitory Management allows of determining the man of
high score, and either using him as a model, or formulating his
method into rules. Under Scientific Management, the instruction
card furnishes a method which the worker knows that he can imitate
exactly, with predetermined results.</p>
<!--Page 258--><a name="P258" id="P258"></a>
<p><b>Imitation Is Expected of All.</b> &mdash; As standardization
applies to the work of all, so imitation of standards is expected
of all. This fact the teacher under Scientific Management can use
to advantage, as an added incentive to imitation. Any dislike of
imitation is further decreased, by making clear to every worker
that those who are under him are expected to imitate him, &mdash;
and that he must, himself, imitate his teachers, in order to set a
worthy example.</p>
<p><b>Imitation Leads to Emulation.</b> &mdash; Imitation, as
provided for by teaching under Scientific Management, and
admiration for the skillful teacher, or the standard imitated,
naturally stimulate emulation. This emulation takes three
forms:</p>
<p>1. Competition with the records of others.</p>
<p>2. Competition with one's own record.</p>
<p>3. Competition with the standard record.</p>
<p><b>No Hard Feeling Aroused.</b> &mdash; In the first sort of
competition only is there a possibility of hard feeling being
aroused, but danger of this is practically eliminated by the fact
that rewards are provided for all who are successful. In the second
sort of competition, the worker, by matching himself against what
he has done, measures his own increased efficiency. In the third
sort of competition, there is the added stimulus of surprising the
management by exceeding the task expected. The incentive in all
three cases is not only more pay and a chance for promotion, but
also the opportunity to win appreciation and publicity for
successful performance.</p>
<p><b>Ambition Is Aroused.</b> &mdash; The outcome of emulation is
ambition. This ambition is stimulated by the
<!--Page 259--><a name="P259" id="P259"></a> fact that promotion
is so rapid, and so outlined before the worker, that he sees the
chance for advancement himself, and not only advancement that means
more pay, but advancement also that means a chance to specialize on
that work which he particularly likes.</p>
<p><b>Pugnacity Utilized.</b> &mdash; Pugnacity can never be
entirely absent where there is emulation. Under Scientific
Management it is used to overcome not persons, but things.
Pugnacity is a great driving force. It is a wonderful thing that
under Scientific Management this force is aroused not against one's
fellow-workers, but against one's work. The desire to win out, to
fight it out, is aroused against a large task, which the man
desires to put behind him. Moreover, there is nothing under
Scientific Management which forbids an athletic contest. While the
workers would not, under the ultimate form, be allowed to injure
themselves by overspeeding, a friendly race with a demonstration of
pugnacity which harms no one is not frowned upon.</p>
<p><b>Pride Is Stimulated.</b> &mdash; Pride in one's work is
aroused as soon as work is functionalized. The moment a man has
something to do that he likes to do, and can do well, he takes
pride in it. So, also, the fact that individuality, and
personality, are recognized, and that his records are shown, makes
pride serve as a stimulus. The outcome of the worker's pride in his
work is pride in himself. He finds that he is part of a great
whole, and he learns to take pride in the entire management,
&mdash; in both himself and the managers, as well as in his own
work.</p>
<p><b>Feeling of Ownership Provided For.</b> &mdash; It may
<!--Page 260--><a name="P260" id="P260"></a> seem at first
glance that the instinct of ownership is neglected, and becomes
stunted, under Scientific Management, in that all tools become more
or less standardized, and the man is discouraged from having tools
peculiar in shape, or size, for whose use he has no warrant except
long time of use.</p>
<p>Careful consideration shows that Scientific Management provides
two opportunities for the worker to conserve his instinct for
ownership, &mdash;</p>
<p>1. During working hours, where the recognition of his
personality allows the worker to identify himself with his work,
and where his co&ouml;peration with the management makes him
identified with its activities.</p>
<p>2. Outside the work. He has, under Scientific Management, more
hours away from work to enjoy ownership, and more money with which
to acquire those things that he desires to own.</p>
<p>The teacher must make clear to him both these opportunities, as
he readily can, since the instinct of ownership is conserved in him
in an identical manner.</p>
<p><b>Constructiveness a Part of Scientific Management.</b> &mdash;
Every act that the worker performs is constructive, because waste
has been eliminated, and everything that is done is upbuilding.
Teaching makes this clear to the worker. Constructiveness is also
utilized in that exercise of initiative is provided for. Thus the
instinct, instead of being weakened, is strengthened and
directed.</p>
<p><b>Progress in Utilizing Instincts Demands Psychological
Study.</b> &mdash; Teaching under Scientific Management can never
hope fully to understand and utilize <!--Page 261--><a name="P261"
id="P261"></a> native reactions, until more assistance has been
given by psychology. At the present time, Scientific Management
labors under disadvantages that must, ultimately, be removed.
Psychologists must, by experiments, determine more accurately the
reactions and their controlability. More thorough study must be
made of children that Scientific Management may understand more of
the nature of the reactions of the young workers who come for
industrial training. Psychology must give its help in this
training. Then only, can teaching under Scientific Management
become truly efficient.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Realizes the Importance of Training the
Will.</b> &mdash; The most necessary, and most complex and
difficult part of Scientific Management, is the training of the
will of all members of the organization. Prof. Read states in his
"Psychology" five means of training or influencing the will. These
are<a href="#ch08fn59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>"1. The first important feature in training the will is the help
furnished by supplying the mind with a useful body of ideas.</p>
<p>"2. The second great feature of the training of the will is the
building up in the mind of the proper interests, and the habit of
giving the attention to useful and worthy purposes.</p>
<p>"3. Another important feature of the training of the will is the
establishing of a firm association between ideas and actions, or,
in other words, the forming of a good set of habits.</p>
<p>"4. Another very important feature of the training
<!--Page 262--><a name="P262" id="P262"></a> of the will has
reference to its strength of purpose or power of imitation.</p>
<p>"5. The matter of discipline."</p>
<p>Teaching under Scientific Management does supply these five
functions, and thus provide for the strengthening and development
of the will.</p>
<p><b>Variations in Teaching of Apprentices and Journeymen.</b>
&mdash; Scientific Management must not only be prepared to teach
apprentices, as must all types of management, it must also teach
journeymen who have not acquired standard methods.</p>
<p><b>Apprentices Are Easily Handled.</b> &mdash; Teaching
apprentices is a comparatively simple proposition, far simpler than
under any other type of management. Standard methods enable the
apprentice to become proficient long before his brother could,
under the old type of teaching. The length of training required
depends largely on how fingerwise the apprentice is.</p>
<p><b>Older Workers Must Be Handled with Tact.</b> &mdash; With
adult workers, the problem is not so simple. Old wrong habits, such
as the use of ineffective motions, must be eliminated. Physically,
it is difficult for the adult worker to alter his methods.
Moreover, it may be most difficult to change his mental attitude,
to convince him that the methods of Scientific Management are
correct.</p>
<p>A successful worker under Traditional Management, who is proud
of his work, will often be extremely sensitive to what he is prone
to regard as the "criticism" of Scientific Management with regard
to him.</p>
<!--Page 263--><a name="P263" id="P263"></a>
<p><b>Appreciation of Varying Viewpoints Necessary.</b> &mdash; No
management can consider itself adequate that does not try to enter
into the mental attitude of its workers. Actual practice shows
that, with time and tact, almost any worker can be convinced that
all criticism of him is constructive, and that for him to conform
to the new standards is a mark of added proficiency, not an
acknowledgment of ill-preparedness. The "Systems" do much toward
this work of reconciling the older workers to the new methods, but
most of all can be done by such teachers as can demonstrate their
own change from old to standard methods, and the consequent
promotion and success. This is, again, an opportunity for the
exercise of personality.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Provides Places for Such Teaching.</b>
&mdash; Under the methods of teaching employed by Scientific
Management, &mdash; right motions first, next speed, with quality
as a resultant product, &mdash; it is most necessary to provide a
place where learners can work. The standard planning of quality
provides such a place. The plus and minus signs automatically
divide labor so that the worker can be taught by degrees, being set
at first where great accuracy is not demanded by the work, and
being shifted to work requiring more accuracy as he becomes more
proficient. In this way even the most untrained worker becomes
efficient, and is engaged in actual productive work.</p>
<p><b>Measurement of Teaching and Learning.</b> &mdash; Under
Scientific Management the results of teaching and learning become
apparent automatically in records <!--Page 264--><a name="P264" id=
"P264"></a> of output. The learner's record of output of proper
prescribed quality determines what pay he shall receive, and also
has a proportionate effect on the teacher's pay. Such a system of
measurement may not be accurate as a report of the learner's gain,
&mdash; for he doubtless gains mental results that cannot be seen
in his output, &mdash; but it certainly does serve as an incentive
to teaching and to learning.</p>
<p><b>Relation of Teaching in Scientific Management to Academic
Training and Vocational Guidance.</b> <a href=
"#ch08fn60"><sup>60</sup></a> &mdash; Teaching under Scientific
Management can never be most efficient until the field of such
teaching is restricted to training learners who are properly
prepared to receive industrial training. <a href=
"#ch08fn61"><sup>61</sup></a> This preparedness implies fitting
school and academic training, and Vocational Guidance.</p>
<p><b>Learner Should Be Manually Adept.</b> &mdash; The learner
should, before entering the industrial world, be taught to be
manually adept, or fingerwise, to have such control over his
trained muscles that they will respond quickly and accurately to
orders. Such training should be started in infancy, <a href=
"#ch08fn62"><sup>62</sup></a> in the form of guided play, as, for
example, whittling, sewing, knitting, handling mechanical toys and
tools, and playing musical instruments, and continued up to, and
into, the period of entering a trade.</p>
<!--Page 265--><a name="P265" id="P265"></a>
<p><b>Schools Should Provide Mental Preparedness.</b> &mdash; The
schools should render every student capable of filling some place
worthily in the industries. The longer the student remains in
school, the higher the position for which he should be prepared.
The amount and nature of the training in the schools depends
largely on the industrial work to be done, and will be possible of
more accurate estimation constantly, as Scientific Management
standardizes work and shows what the worker must be to be most
efficient.</p>
<p><b>Vocational Guidance Must Provide Direction.</b> &mdash; As
made most clear in Mr. Meyer Bloomfield's book, "Vocational
Guidance,"<a href="#ch08fn63"><sup>63</sup></a> bureaus of
competent directors stand ready to help the youth find that line of
activity which he can follow best and with greatest satisfaction to
himself. At present, such bureaus are seriously handicapped by the
fact that little data of the industries are at hand, but this lack
the bureaus are rapidly supplying by gathering such data as are
available. Most valuable data will not be available until
Scientific Management has been introduced into all lines.</p>
<p><b>Progress Demands Co&ouml;peration.</b> &mdash; Progress here,
as everywhere, demands co&ouml;peration. <a href=
"#ch08fn64"><sup>64</sup></a> The three sets of educators, &mdash;
the teachers in the school, in the Vocational Guidance Bureaus, and
in Scientific Management, must recognize their common work,
<!--Page 266--><a name="P266" id="P266"></a> and must
co&ouml;perate to do it. There is absolutely no cause for conflict
between the three; their fields are distinct, but supplementary.
Vocational Guidance is the intermediary between the other two.</p>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p><b>Results to the Work.</b> &mdash; Under the teaching of
Traditional Management, the learner may or may not improve the
quantity and quality of his work. This depends almost entirely on
the particular teacher whom the learner happens to have. There is
no standard improvement to the work.</p>
<p>Under the teaching of Transitory Management, the work gains in
quantity as the methods become standardized, and quality is
maintained or improved.</p>
<p>Under the teaching of Scientific Management, work, the quantity
of work, increases enormously through the use of standards of all
kinds; quantity is oftentimes tripled.</p>
<p>Under the teaching of Scientific Management, when the schools
and Vocational Guidance movement co&ouml;perate, high output of
required quality will be obtained at a far earlier stage of the
worker's industrial life than is now possible, even under
Scientific Management.</p>
<p><b>Results to the Worker.</b> &mdash; Under Traditional
Management, the worker gains a knowledge of how his work can be
done, but the method by which he is taught is seldom, of itself,
helpful to him. Not being sure that he has learned the best way to
do his work, he gains no method of attack. The result of
<!--Page 267--><a name="P267" id="P267"></a> the teaching is a
habit of doing work which is good, or bad, as chance may
direct.</p>
<p>Under Transitory Management, with the use of Systems as
teachers, the worker gains a better method of attack, as he knows
the reason why the prescribed method is prescribed. He begins to
appreciate the possibilities and benefits of standardized
teaching.</p>
<p>The method laid down under Scientific Management is devised to
further the forming of an accurate accumulation of concepts, which
results in a proper method of attack. The method of instruction
under Scientific Management is devised to furnish two things:</p>
<p>1. A collection of knowledge relating in its entirety to the
future work of the learner.</p>
<p>2. A definite procedure, that will enable the learner to apply
the same process to acquiring knowledge of other subjects in the
most economical and efficient way.</p>
<p>It teaches the learner to be observant of details, which is the
surest method for further development of general truths and
concepts.</p>
<p>The method of attack of the methods provided for in Scientific
Management results, naturally, in a comparison of true data. This
is the most efficient method of causing the learner to think for
himself.</p>
<p>Processes differing but little, apparently, give vastly
different results, and the trained habits of observation quickly
analyze and determine wherein the one process is more efficient
than the other.</p>
<!--Page 268--><a name="P268" id="P268"></a>
<p>This result is, of course, the one most desired for causing
quick and intelligent learning.</p>
<p>The most valuable education is that which enables the learner to
make correct judgments. The teaching under Scientific Management
leads to the acquisition of such judgment, plus an all-around sense
training, a training in habits of work, and a progressive
development.</p>
<p>A partial topic list of the results may make more clear their
importance.</p>
<p>&ensp;1. Worker better trained for all work.</p>
<p>&ensp;2. Habits of correct thinking instilled.</p>
<p>&ensp;3. Preparedness provided for.</p>
<p>&ensp;4. Productive and repetitive powers increased.</p>
<p>&ensp;5. Sense powers increased.</p>
<p>&ensp;6. Habits of proper reaction established.</p>
<p>&ensp;7. "Guided original work" established.</p>
<p>&ensp;8. System of waste elimination provided.</p>
<p>&ensp;9. Method of attack taught.</p>
<p>10. Brain fully developed.</p>
<p>11. "Standard response" developed.</p>
<p>12. Opportunities and demands for "thinking" provided.</p>
<p>13. Self-reliance developed.</p>
<p>14. Love of truth fostered.</p>
<p>15. Moral sentiment developed.</p>
<p>16. Resultant happiness of worker.</p>
<p><b>Results To Be Expected in the Future.</b> &mdash; When the
schools, vocational guidance and teaching under Scientific
Management co&ouml;perate, the worker will not only receive the
benefits now obtained from Scientific Management, but many more.
There will <!--Page 269--><a name="P269" id="P269"></a> be
nothing to unlearn, and each thing that is learned will be taught
by those best fitted to teach it. The collection of vocational
guidance data will begin with a child at birth, and a record of his
inheritance will be kept. This will be added to as he is educated,
and as various traits and tendencies appear. From this
scientifically derived record will accrue such data as will assist
in making clear exactly in what place the worker will be most
efficient, and in what sphere he will be able to be most helpful to
the world, as well as to himself. All early training will be
planned to make the youth adept with his muscles, and alert, with a
mind so trained that related knowledge is easily acquired.</p>
<p>When the vocation for which he is naturally best fitted becomes
apparent, as it must from the study of the development of the youth
and his desires, the school will know, and can give exactly, that
training that is necessary for the vocation. It can also supplement
his limitations intelligently, in case he decides to follow a
vocation for which he is naturally handicapped.</p>
<p>This will bring to the industry learners prepared to be taught
those things that characterize the industry, the "tricks of the
trade," and the "secrets of the craft," now become standard, and
free to all. Such teaching Scientific Management is prepared to
give. The results of such teaching of Scientific Management will be
a worker prepared in a short time to fill efficiently a position
which will allow of promotion to the limit of his
possibilities.</p>
<p>The result of such teaching will be truly educated
<!--Page 270--><a name="P270" id="P270"></a> workers, equipped
to work, and to live,<a href="#ch08fn65"><sup>65</sup></a> and to
share the world's permanent satisfactions.</p>
<p>The effect of such education on industrial peace must not be
underestimated. With education, including in education learning and
culture, &mdash; prejudice will disappear. The fact that all men,
those going into industries and those not, will be taught alike to
be finger wise as well as book wise, up to the time of entering the
industries, will lead to a better understanding of each other all
through life.</p>
<p>The entire bearing of Scientific Management on industrial peace
cannot be here fully discussed. We must note here the strong effect
that teaching under Scientific Management will ultimately have on
doing away with industrial warfare, &mdash; the great warfare of
ignorance, where neither side understands the other, and where each
side should realize that large immediate sacrifices should be made
if necessary, that there may be obtained the great permanent
benefit and savings that can be obtained only by means of the
heartiest co&ouml;peration.</p>

<h3>INCENTIVES</h3>
<p><b>Definition of Incentive.</b> &mdash; An "incentive" is
defined by the Century Dictionary as "that which moves the mind or
stirs the passions; that which incites or tends to incite to
action; motive, spur." Synonyms &mdash; "impulse, stimulus,
incitement, encouragement, goad."</p>
<p><b>Importance of the Incentive.</b> &mdash; The part that the
incentive plays in the doing of all work is enormous. This is true
in learning, and also in the performance of work which is the
result of this learning: manual work and mental work as well. The
business man finishing his work early that he may go to the
baseball game; the boy at school rushing through his arithmetic
that he may not be kept after school; the piece-worker, the amount
of whose day's pay depends upon the quantity and quality he can
produce; the student of a foreign language preparing for a trip
abroad, &mdash; these all illustrate the importance of the
incentive as an element in the amount which is to be
accomplished.</p>
<p><b>Two Kinds of Incentives.</b> &mdash; The incentive may be of
two kinds: it may be first of all, a return, definite or
indefinite, which is to be received when a certain
<!--Page 272--><a name="P272" id="P272"></a> portion of the work
is done, or it may be an incentive due to the working conditions
themselves. The latter case is exemplified where two people are
engaged in the same sort of work and start in to race one another
to see who can accomplish the most, who can finish the fixed amount
in the shortest space of time, or who can produce the best quality.
The incentive may be in the form of some definite aim or goal which
is understood by the worker himself, or it may be in some natural
instinct which is roused by the work, either consciously to the
worker, or consciously to the man who is assigning the work, or
consciously to both, or consciously to neither one. In any of these
cases it is a natural instinct that is being appealed to and that
induces the man to do more work, whether he sees any material
reward for that work or not.</p>
<p><b>Definitions of Two Types.</b> &mdash; We may call the
incentive which utilizes the natural instinct, "direct incentive,"
and the incentive which utilizes these secondarily, through some
set reward or punishment, "indirect incentive." This, at first
sight, may seem a contradictory use of terms &mdash; it may seem
that the reward would be the most direct of incentives; yet a
moment's thought will cause one to realize that all the reward can
possibly do is to arouse in the individual a natural instinct which
will lead him to increase his work.</p>
<p><b>Indirect Incentives Include Two Classes.</b> &mdash; We will
discuss the indirect incentives first as, contrary to the usual use
of the word "indirect," they are most easy to estimate and to
describe. They divide themselves into two classes, reward and
punishment.</p>
<!--Page 273--><a name="P273" id="P273"></a>
<p><b>Definition of Reward.</b> &mdash; Reward is defined by the
Century Dictionary as &mdash; "return, recompense, the fruit of
one's labor or works; profit," with synonyms, "pay, compensation,
remuneration, requital and retribution." Note particularly the word
"retribution," for it is this aspect of reward, that is, the just
outcome of one's act, that makes the reward justly include
punishment. The word "reward" exactly expresses what management
would wish to be understood by the incentive that it gives its men
to increase their work.</p>
<p><b>Definition of Punishment.</b> &mdash; The word "punishment"
is defined as &mdash; "pain, suffering, loss, confinement, or other
penalty inflicted on a person for a crime or offense by the
authority to which the offender is subject," with synonyms,
"chastisement, correction, discipline."</p>
<p>The word punishment, as will be noted later, is most unfortunate
when applied to what Scientific Management would mean by a penalty,
though this word also is unfortunate; but, in the first place,
there is no better word to cover the general meaning; and in the
second place, the idea of pain and suffering, which Scientific
Management aims to and does eliminate, is present in some of the
older forms of management Therefore the word punishment must
stand.</p>
<p><b>Rewards and Punishments Result in Action.</b> &mdash; There
can be no doubt that a reward is an incentive. There may well be
doubt as to whether a punishment is an incentive to action or not.
This, however, is only at first glance, and the whole thing rests
<!--Page 274--><a name="P274" id="P274"></a> on the meaning of
the word "action." To be active is certainly the opposite of being
at rest. This being true, punishment is just as surely an incentive
to action as is reward. The man who is punished in every case will
be led to some sort of action. Whether this really results in an
increase of output or not simply determines whether the punishment
is a scientifically prescribed punishment or not. If the punishment
is of such a nature that the output ceases because of it, or that
it incites the man punished against the general good, then it does
not in any wise cease to be an active thing, but it is simply a
wrong, and unscientifically assigned punishment, that acts in a
detrimental way.</p>
<p><b>Soldiering Alone Cuts Down Activity.</b> &mdash; It is
interesting to note that the greatest cause for cutting down output
is related more closely to a reward than a punishment. Under such
managements as provide no adequate reward for all, and no adequate
assurance that all can receive extra rewards permanently without a
cut in the rate, it may be advisable, for the worker's best
interests, to limit output in order to keep the wages, or reward,
up, and soldiering results. The evils of soldiering will be
discussed more at length under the "Systems of Pay." It is plain,
however, here that soldiering is the result of a cutting down of
action, and it is self-evident that anything which cuts down action
is harmful, not only to the individual himself, but to society at
large.</p>
<p><b>Nature of Rewards and Punishments.</b> &mdash; Under all
types of management, the principal rewards consist
<!--Page 275--><a name="P275" id="P275"></a> of promotion and
pay, pay being a broad word used here to include regular wages, a
bonus, shorter hours, other forms of remuneration or recompense;
anything which can be given to the man who does the work to benefit
him and increase his desire to continue doing the work. Punishments
may be negative, that is, they may simply take the form of no
reward; or they may be positive, that is, they may include fines,
discharge, assignment to less remunerative or less desirable work,
or any other thing which can be given to the man to show him that
he has not done what is expected of him and, in theory at least, to
lead him to do better.</p>
<p><b>Nature of Direct Incentives.</b> &mdash; Direct incentives
will be such native reaction as ambition, pride and pugnacity; will
be love of racing, love of play; love of personal recognition; will
be the outcome of self-confidence and interest, and so on.</p>
<p><b>The Reward Under Traditional Management Unstandardized.</b>
&mdash; As with all other discussions of any part or form of
Traditional Management, the discussion of the incentive under
Traditional Management is vague from the very nature of the
subject. "Traditional" stands for vagueness and for variation, for
the lack of standardization, for the lack of definiteness in
knowledge, in process, in results. The rewards under Traditional
Management, as under all types of management, are promotion and
pay. It must be an almost unthinkably poor system of management,
even under Traditional Management, which did not attempt to provide
for some sort of promotion of the man who did the most and best
<!--Page 276--><a name="P276" id="P276"></a> work; but the lack
of standardization of conditions, of instructions, of the work
itself, and of reward, makes it almost impossible not only to give
the reward, but even to determine who deserves the reward. Under
Traditional Management, the reward need not be positive, that is,
it might simply consist in the negation of some previously existing
disadvantage. It need not be predetermined. It might be nothing
definite. It might not be so set ahead that the man might look
forward to it. In other words it might simply be the outcome of the
good, and in no wise the incentive for the good. It need not
necessarily be personal. It could be shared with a group, or gang,
and lose all feeling of personality. It need not be a fixed reward
or a fixed performance; in fact, if the management were Traditional
it would be almost impossible that it would be a fixed reward. It
might not be an assured reward, and in most cases it was not a
prompt reward. These fixed adjectives describe the reward of
Scientific Management &mdash; positive, predetermined, personal,
fixed, assured and prompt. A few of these might apply, or none
might apply to the reward under Traditional Management.</p>
<p><b>Reward a Prize Won by One Only.</b> &mdash; If this reward,
whether promotion or pay, was given to someone under Traditional
Management, this usually meant that others thereby lost it; it was
in the nature of a prize which one only could attain, and which the
others, therefore, would lose, and such a lost prize is, to the
average man, for the time at least, a dampener on action. The
rewarding of the winner, <!--Page 277--><a name="P277" id=
"P277"></a> to the loss of all of the losers, has been met by
the workmen getting together secretly, and selecting the winners
for a week or more ahead, thus getting the same reward out of the
employer without the extra effort.</p>
<p><b>Punishment Under Traditional Management Wrong in Theory.</b>
&mdash; The punishment, under Traditional Management, was usually
much more than negative punishment; that is to say, the man who was
punished usually received much more than simply the negative return
of getting no reward. The days of bodily punishment have long
passed, yet the account of the beatings given to the galley slaves
and to other workers in the past are too vividly described in
authentic accounts to be lost from memory. To-day, under
Traditional Management, punishment consists of</p>
<p>1. fines, which are usually simply a cutting down of wages, the
part deducted remaining with the company,</p>
<p>2. discharge, or</p>
<p>3. assignment to less pleasant or less desirable work.</p>
<p>This assignment is done on an unscientific basis, the man being
simply put at something which he dislikes, with no regard as to
whether his efficiency at that particular work will be high or
not.</p>
<p><b>Results Are Unfortunate.</b> &mdash; The punishment, under
Traditional Management, is usually meted out by the foreman, simply
as one of his many duties. He is apt to be so personally
interested, and perhaps involved, in the case that his punishment
will <!--Page 278--><a name="P278" id="P278"></a> satisfy some
wrong notions, impulse of anger, hate, or envy in him, and will
arouse a feeling of shame or wounded pride, or unappreciation, in
the man to whom punishment is awarded.</p>
<p><b>Direct Incentives Not Scientifically Utilized.</b> &mdash; As
for what we have called direct incentive, the love of racing was
often used under Traditional Management through Athletic Contests,
the faults in these being that the men were not properly studied,
so that they could be properly assigned and grouped; care was not
always exercised that hate should not be the result of the contest;
the contest was not always conducted according to the rules of
clean sport; the men slighted quality in hastening the work, and
the results of the athletic contests were not so written down as to
be thereafter utilized. Love of play may have been developed
unconsciously, but was certainly not often studied, Love of
personal recognition was probably often utilized, but in no
scientific way. Neither was there anything in Traditional
Management to develop self-confidence, or to arouse and maintain
interest in any set fashion. Naturally, if the man were in a work
which he particularly liked, which under Traditional Management was
a matter of luck, he would be more or less interested in it, but
there was no scientific way of arousing or holding his interest.
Under Traditional Management, a man might take pride in his work,
as did many of the old bricklayers and masons, who would set
themselves apart after hours if necessary, lock themselves in, and
cut bricks for a complicated arch or fancy pattern, but such pride
was in no way fostered <!--Page 279--><a name="P279" id=
"P279"></a> through the efforts of the management. Pugnacity was
aroused, but it might have an evil effect as well as a good, so far
as the management had any control. Ambition, in the same way, might
be stimulated, and might not. There is absolutely nothing under
Traditional Management to prevent a man being ambitious, gratifying
his pride, and gratifying his pugnacity in a right way, and at the
same time being interested in his work, but there was nothing under
Traditional Management which provided for definite and exact
methods for encouraging these good qualities, seeing that they
developed in a proper channel, and scientifically utilizing the
outcome again and again.</p>
<p><b>Pay for Performance Provided for by Transitory
Management.</b> &mdash; Under Transitory Management, as soon as
practicable, one bonus is paid for doing work according to the
method prescribed. As standardization takes place, the second bonus
for completing the task in the time set can be paid. As each
element of Scientific Management is introduced, incentives become
more apparent, more powerful, and more assured.</p>
<p><b>Direct Incentives More Skillfully Used.</b> &mdash; With the
separating of output, and recording of output separately, love of
personal recognition grew, self-confidence grew, interest in one's
work grew. The Athletic Contest is so conducted that love of speed,
love of play, and love of competition are encouraged, the worker
constantly feeling that he can indulge in these, as he is assured
of "fair play."</p>
<p><b>Incentives Under Scientific Management Constructive.</b>
&mdash; <!--Page 280--><a name="P280" id="P280"></a> It is most
important, psychologically and ethically, that it be understood
that Scientific Management is not in any sense a destructive power.
That only is eliminated that is harmful, or wasteful, or futile;
everything that is good is conserved, and is utilized as much as it
has ever been before, often much more than it has ever been
utilized. The constructive force, under Scientific Management, is
one of its great life principles. This is brought out very plainly
in considering incentives under Scientific Management. With the
scientifically determined wage, and the more direct and more sure
plan of promotion, comes no discard of the well-grounded incentives
of older types of management. The value of a fine personality in
all who are to be imitated is not forgotten; the importance of
using all natural stimuli to healthful activity is appreciated.
Scientific Management uses all these, in so far as they can be used
to the best outcome for workers and work, and supplements them by
such scientifically derived additions as could never have been
derived under the older types.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics of the Reward.</b> &mdash; Rewards, under
Scientific Management are &mdash;</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) positive; that is to say, the reward must be
a definite, positive gain to the man, and not simply a taking away
of some thing which may have been a drawback.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) predetermined; that is to say, before the
man begins to work it must be determined exactly what reward he is
to get for doing the work. <!--Page 281--><a name="P281" id=
"P281"></a></p>
<p class="ltritem">(c) personal; that is, individual, a reward for
that particular man for that particular work.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(d) fixed, unchanged. He must get exactly what
it has been determined beforehand that he shall get.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(e) assured; that is to say, there must be
provision made for this reward before the man begins to work, so
that he may be positive that he will get the reward if he does the
work. The record of the organization must be that rewards have
always been paid in the past, therefore probably will be in the
future.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(f) the reward must be prompt; that is to say,
as soon as the work has been done, the man must get the reward.
This promptness applies to the announcement of the reward; that is
to say, the man must know at once that he has gotten the reward,
and also to the receipt of the reward by the man.</p>
<p><b>Positive Reward Arouses Interest and Holds Attention.</b>
&mdash; The benefit of the positive reward is that it arouses and
holds attention. A fine example of a reward that is not positive is
that type of "welfare work" which consists of simply providing the
worker with such surroundings as will enable him to work decently
and without actual discomfort. The worker, naturally, feels that
such surroundings are his right, and in no sense a reward and
incentive to added activity. The reward must actually offer to the
worker something which he has a right to expect
<!--Page 282--><a name="P282" id="P282"></a> only if he earns
it; something which will be a positive addition to his life.</p>
<p><b>Predetermined Reward Concentrates Attention.</b> &mdash; The
predetermined reward allows both manager and man to concentrate
their minds upon the work. There is no shifting of the attention,
while the worker wonders what the reward that he is to receive will
be. It is also a strong factor for industrial peace, and for all
the extra activities which will come when industrial conditions are
peaceful.</p>
<p><b>Personal Reward Conserves Individuality.</b> &mdash; The
personal reward is a strong incentive toward initiative, towards
the desire to make the most of one's individuality. It is an aid
toward the feeling of personal recognition. From this personal
reward come all the benefits which have been considered under
individuality.<a href="#ch09fn01"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Fixed Reward Eliminates Waste Time.</b> &mdash; The fact that
the reward is fixed is a great eliminator of waste to the man and
to the manager both. Not only does the man concentrate better under
the fixed reward, but the reward, being fixed, need not be
determined anew, over and over again; that is to say, every time
that that kind of work is done, simultaneous with the arising of
the work comes the reward that is to be paid for it. All the time
that would be given to determining the reward, satisfying the men
and arguing the case, is saved and utilized.</p>
<p><b>Assured Reward Aids Concentration.</b> &mdash; The assured
reward leads to concentration, &mdash; even perhaps
<!--Page 283--><a name="P283" id="P283"></a> more so than the
fact that the reward is determined. In case the man was not sure
that he would get the reward in the end, he would naturally spend a
great deal of time wondering whether he would or not. Moreover, no
immediate good fortune counts for much as an incentive if there is
a prospect of bad luck following in the immediate future.</p>
<p><b>Need for Promptness Varies.</b> &mdash; The need for
promptness of the reward varies. If the reward is to be given to a
man of an elementary type of mind, the reward must be immediately
announced and must be actually given very promptly, as it is
impossible for anyone of such a type of intellect to look forward
very far.<a href="#ch09fn02"><sup>2</sup></a> A man of a high type
of intellectual development is able to wait a longer time for his
reward, and the element of promptness, while acting somewhat as an
incentive, is not so necessary.</p>
<p>Under Scientific Management, with the ordinary type of worker on
manual work, it has been found most satisfactory to pay the reward
every day, or at the end of the week, and to announce the score of
output as often as every hour. This not only satisfies the longing
of the normal mind to know exactly where it stands, but also lends
a fresh impetus to repeat the high record. There is also, through
the prompt reward, the elimination of time wasted in wondering what
the result will be, and in allaying suspense. Suspense is not a
stimulus to great activity, as anyone who has waited for the result
of a doubtful examination can testify, it being almost impossible
<!--Page 284--><a name="P284" id="P284"></a> to concentrate the
mind on any other work until one knows whether the work which has
been done has been completed satisfactorily or not.</p>
<p><b>Promptness Always an Added Incentive.</b> &mdash; There are
many kinds of life work and modes of living so terrible as to make
one shudder at the thoughts of the certain sickness, death, or
disaster that are almost absolutely sure to follow such a vocation.
Men continue to work for those wages that lead positively to
certain death, because of the immediateness of the sufficient
wages, or reward. This takes their attention from their ultimate
end. Much more money would be required if payment were postponed,
say, five years after the act, to obtain the services of the
air-man, or the worker subject to the poisoning of some branches of
the lead and mercury industries.</p>
<p>If the prompt reward is incentive enough to make men forget
danger and threatened death, how much more efficient is it in
increasing output where there is no such danger.</p>
<p><b>Immediate Reward Not Always Preferable.</b> &mdash; There are
cases where the prompt reward is not to be preferred, because the
delayed reward will be greater, or will be available to more people
Such is the case with the reward that comes from unrestricted
output.</p>
<p>For example, &mdash; the immediacy of the temporarily increased
reward caused by restricting output has often led the combinations
of working men to such restriction, with an ultimate loss of reward
to worker, to employer, and to the consumer.</p>
<p><b>Rewards Possible of Attainment by All.</b> &mdash; Every
<!--Page 285--><a name="P285" id="P285"></a> man working under
Scientific Management has a chance to win a reward. This means not
only that the man has a "square deal," for the man may have a
square deal under Traditional Management in that he may have a fair
chance to try for all existing rewards. There is more than this
under Scientific Management. By the very nature of the plan itself,
the rewards are possible of achievement by all; any one man, by
winning, in no way diminishes the chances of the others.</p>
<p><b>Rewards of Management Resemble Rewards of Workers.</b>
&mdash; So far the emphasis, in the discussion of reward, has been
on the reward as given to the worker, and his feeling toward it.
The reward to the management is just as sure. It lies in the
increased output and therefore the possibility of lower costs and
of greater financial gain. It is as positive; it is as
predetermined, because before the reward to the men is fixed the
management realizes what proportion that reward will bear to the
entire undertaking, and exactly what profits can be obtained. It is
a fundamental of Scientific Management that the management shall be
able to prophesy the outputs ahead. It will certainly be as
personal, if the management side is as thoroughly systematized as
is the managed; it will be as fixed and as assured, and it
certainly is as prompt, as the cost records can be arranged to come
to the management every day, if that is desired.</p>
<p><b>Results of Such Rewards.</b> &mdash; There are three other
advantages to management which might well be added here. First,
that a reward such as this attracts the best men to the work;
second, that the <!--Page 286--><a name="P286" id="P286"></a>
reward, and the stability of it, indicates the stability of the
entire institution, and thus raises its standing in the eyes of the
community as well as in its own eyes; and third, that it leads the
entire organization, both managed and managing, to look favorably
at all standardization. The standardized reward is sure to be
attractive to all members. As soon as it is realized that the
reason that it is attractive is because it is <i>standardized</i>,
the entire subject of standardization rises in the estimation of
every one, and the introduction of standards can be carried on more
rapidly, and with greater success.</p>
<p><b>Rewards Divided into Promotion and Pay.</b> &mdash; Rewards
may be divided into two kinds; first, promotion and, second, pay.
Under Scientific Management promotion is assured for every man and,
as has been said, this promotion does not thereby hold back others
from having the same sort of promotion. There is an ample place,
under Scientific Management, for every man to advance. <a href=
"#ch09fn03"><sup>3</sup></a> Not only is the promotion sure, thus
giving the man absolute assurance that he will advance as his work
is satisfactory, but it is also gradual.<a href=
"#ch09fn04"><sup>4</sup></a> The promotion must be by degrees,
otherwise the workers may get discouraged, from finding their
promotion has come faster than has their ability to achieve, and
the lack of attention, due to being discouraged, may be contagious.
It is, therefore, of vital importance that the worker be properly
selected, in order that, in his advancement and promotion, he shall
be able to achieve <!--Page 287--><a name="P287" id="P287"></a>
his task after having been put at the new work. He must be advanced
and promoted in a definite line of gradual development, in
accordance with a fully conceived plan. This should be worked out
and set down in writing as a definite plan, similar to the plan on
the instruction card of one of his tasks.</p>
<p><b>Promotion May Be to Places Within or Without the
Business.</b> &mdash; In many lines of business, the business
itself offers ample opportunity for promoting all men who can "make
good" as rapidly as they can prepare themselves for positions over
others, and for advancement; but under Scientific Management
provision is made even in case the business does not offer such
opportunities.<a href="#ch09fn05"><sup>5</sup></a> This is done by
the management finding places outside their own organization for
the men who are so trained that they can be advanced.</p>
<p><b>Such Promotion Attracts Workers.</b> &mdash; While at first
glance it might seem a most unfortunate thing for the management to
have to let its men go, and while, as Dr. Taylor says, it is
unfortunate for a business to get the reputation of being nothing
but a training school, on the other hand, it has a very salutary
effect upon the men to know that their employers are so
disinterestedly interested in them that they will provide for their
future, even at the risk of the individual business at which they
have started having to lose their services. This will not only, as
Dr. Taylor makes clear, stimulate many men in the establishment
whose men go on to take the places of those who
<!--Page 288--><a name="P288" id="P288"></a> are promoted, but
will also be a great inducement to other men to come into a place
that they feel is unselfish and generous.</p>
<p><b>Subdivisions of "Pay."</b> &mdash; Under "Pay" we have
included eight headings:</p>
<p>1. Wages</p>
<p>2. Bonus</p>
<p>3. Shorter hours</p>
<p>4. Prizes other than money</p>
<p>5. Extra knowledge</p>
<p>6. Method of attack</p>
<p>7. Good opinion of others</p>
<p>8. Professional standing.</p>
<p><b>Relation Between Wages and Bonus.</b> &mdash; Wages and bonus
are closely related. By wages we mean a fixed sum, or minimum
hourly rate, that the man gets in any case for his time, and by
bonus we mean additional money that he receives for achievement of
method, quantity or quality. Both might very properly be included
under wages, or under money received for the work, or opportunities
for receiving money for work, as the case might be. In the
discussion of the different ways of paying wages under Scientific
Management, there will be no attempt to discuss the economic value
of the various means; the different methods will simply be stated,
and the psychological significance will be, as far as possible,
given.</p>
<p>Before discussing the various kinds of wages advised by the
experts in Scientific Management, it is well to pause a moment to
name the various sorts of methods of compensation recognized by
authorities. <!--Page 289--><a name="P289" id="P289"></a> David
F. Schloss in his "Method of Industrial Remuneration" divides all
possible ways of gaining remuneration into three &mdash;</p>
<p>1. the different kinds of wages</p>
<p class="ltritem">1. time wage</p>
<p class="ltritem">2. piece wage</p>
<p class="ltritem">3. task wage</p>
<p class="ltritem">4. progressive wage</p>
<p class="ltritem">5. collective piece wage</p>
<p class="ltritem">6. collective task wage</p>
<p class="ltritem">7. collective progressive wage</p>
<p class="ltritem">8. contract work</p>
<p class="ltritem">9. co&ouml;perative work</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>2. profit sharing, and</p>
<p>3. industrial co&ouml;peration. These are defined and discussed
at length in his book in a lucid and simple manner.</p>
<p>It is only necessary to quote him here as to the relationship
between these different forms, where he says, page 11, &mdash; "The
two leading forms of industrial remuneration under the Wages System
are time wages, and piece wages. Intermediate between these
principal forms, stands that known as task wage, while supplemental
to these two named methods, we find those various systems which
will here be designated by the name of Progressive Wages." <a href=
"#ch09fn06"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Day Work Never Scientific.</b> &mdash; The simplest of all
<!--Page 290--><a name="P290" id="P290"></a> systems, says Dr.
Taylor in "A Piece Rate System," paragraph 10, in discussing the
various forms of compensation "is the Day Work plan, in which the
employ&eacute;s are divided into certain classes, and a standard
rate of wages is paid to each class of men," He adds &mdash; "The
men are paid according to the position which they fill, and not
according to their individual character, energy, skill and
reliability," The psychological objection to day work is that it
does not arouse interest or effort or hold attention, nor does it
inspire to memorizing or to learning.</p>
<p>It will be apparent that there is no inducement whatever for the
man to do more than just enough to retain his job, for he in no
wise shares in the reward for an extra effort, which goes entirely
to his employer. "Reward," in this case, is usually simply a living
wage, &mdash; enough to inspire the man, if he needs the money
enough to work to hold his position, but not enough to incite him
to any extra effort.</p>
<p>It is true that, in actual practice, through the foreman or some
man in authority, the workers on day work may be "speeded up" to a
point where they will do a great deal of work; the foreman being
inspired, of course, by a reward for the extra output, but, as Dr.
Taylor says, paragraph 17 &mdash; "A Piece Rate System," this sort
of speeding up is absolutely lacking in self-sustaining power. The
moment that this rewarded foreman is removed, the work will again
fall down. Therefore, day wage has almost no place in ultimate,
scientifically managed work.</p>
<p><b>Piece Work Provides Pay in Proportion to Work Done.</b>
&mdash; Piece Work is the opposite of time work,
<!--Page 291--><a name="P291" id="P291"></a> in that under it
the man is paid not for the time he spends at the work, but for the
amount of work which he accomplishes. Under this system, as long as
the man is paid a proper piece rate, and a rate high enough to keep
him interested, he will have great inducements to work. He will
have a chance to develop individuality, a chance for competition, a
chance for personal recognition. His love of reasonable racing will
be cultivated. His love of play may be cultivated.</p>
<p>All of these incentives arise because the man feels that his
sense of justice is being considered; that if the task is properly
laid out, and the price per piece is properly determined, he is
given a "square deal" in being allowed to accomplish as great an
amount of work as he can, with the assurance that his reward will
be promptly coming to him.</p>
<p><b>Danger of Rate Being Cut.</b> &mdash; Piece work becomes
objectionable only when the rate is cut. The moment the rate is cut
the first time, the man begins to wonder whether it is going to be
cut again, and his attention is distracted from the work by his
debating this question constantly. At best, his attention wanders
from one subject to the other, and back again. It cannot be
concentrated on his work. After the rate has been cut once or
twice, &mdash; and it is sure to be cut unless it has been set from
scientifically derived elementary time units, &mdash; the man loses
his entire confidence in the stability of the rate, and, naturally,
when he loses this confidence, his work is done more slowly, due to
lack of further enthusiasm. On the contrary, as long as it is to
his <!--Page 292--><a name="P292" id="P292"></a> advantage to do
the work and he is sure that his reward will be prompt, and that he
will always get the price that has been determined as right by him
and by the employers for his work, he can do this work easily in
the time set. As soon as he feels that he will not get it, he will
naturally begin to do less, as it will be not only to his personal
advantage to do as little as possible, but also very much to the
advantage of his fellows, for whom the rate will also be cut.</p>
<p><b>Task Wage Contains No Incentive to Additional Work.</b>
&mdash; What Schloss calls the Task Wage would, as he well says, be
the intermediate between time or day wage and piece wage; that is,
it would be the assigning of a definite amount of work to be done
in definite time, and to be paid for by a definite sum. If the task
were set scientifically, and the time scientifically determined, as
it must naturally be for a scientific task, and the wage adequate
for that work, there would seem to be nothing about this form of
remuneration which could be a cause of dissatisfaction to the
worker. Naturally, however, there would be absolutely no chance for
him to desire to go any faster than the time set, or to accomplish
any more work in the time set than that which he was obliged to, in
that he could not possibly get anything for the extra work
done.</p>
<p><b>Worth of Previous Methods in the Handling.</b> &mdash; It
will be noted in the discussion of the three types of compensation
so far discussed, that there is nothing in them that renders them
unscientific. Any one of the three may be used, and doubtless all
are used, <!--Page 293--><a name="P293" id="P293"></a> on works
which are attempting to operate under Scientific Management.
Whether they really are scientific methods of compensation or not,
is determined by the way that they are handled. Certainly, however,
all that any of these three can expect to do is to convince the man
that he is being treated justly; that is to say, if he knows what
sort of a contract he is entering into, the contract is perfectly
fair, provided that the management keeps its part of the contract,
pays the agreed-upon wage.</p>
<p>In proceeding, instead of following the order of Schloss we will
follow the order, at least for a time, of Dr. Taylor In "A Piece
Rate System"; this for two reasons:</p>
<p>First, for the reason that the "Piece Rate System" is later than
Schloss' book, Schloss being 1891, and the "Piece Rate" being 1895;
in the second place that we are following the Scientific Management
side in distinction to the general economic side, laid down by
Schloss. There is, however, nothing in our plan of discussion here
to prevent one's following fairly closely in the Schloss also.</p>
<p><b>The Gain-sharing Plan.</b> &mdash; We take up, then, the
Gain-sharing Plan which was invented by Mr. Henry R. Towne and used
by him with success in the Yale &amp; Towne works. This is
described in a paper read before the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers, in professional paper No. 341, in 1888 and also in the
Premium Plan, Mr. Halsey's modification of it, described by him in
a paper entitled the "Premium Plan of Paying for Labor," American
Society of Mechanical Engineers, 1891, Paper 449. In this,
<!--Page 294--><a name="P294" id="P294"></a> in describing the
Profit-sharing Plan, Mr. Halsey says &mdash; "Under it, in addition
to regular wages, the employ&eacute;s were offered a certain
percentage of the final profits of the business. It thus divides
the savings due to increased production between employer and
employ&eacute;."</p>
<p><b>Objections to This Plan.</b> &mdash; We note here the
objection to this plan: First, &mdash; "The workmen are given a
share in what they do not earn; second, the workmen share
regardless of individual deserts; third, the promised rewards are
remote; fourth, the plan makes no provision for bad years; fifth,
the workmen have no means of knowing if the agreement is carried
out." Without discussing any farther whether these are worded
exactly as all who have tried the plan might have found them, we
may take these on Mr. Halsey's authority and discuss the psychology
of them. If the workmen are given a share in what they do not earn,
they have absolutely no feeling that they are being treated justly.
This extra reward which is given to them, if in the nature of a
present, might much better be a present out and out. If it has no
scientific relation to what they have gotten, if the workmen share
regardless of individual deserts, this, as Dr. Taylor says,
paragraph 27 in the "Piece Rate System," is the most serious defect
of all, in that it does not allow for recognition of the personal
merits of each workman. If the rewards are remote, the interest is
diminished. If the plan makes no provision for bad years, it cannot
be self-perpetuating. If the workmen have no means of knowing if
the agreement will be carried out or not, they will be constantly
<!--Page 295--><a name="P295" id="P295"></a> wondering whether
it is being carried out or not, and their attention will
wander.</p>
<p><b>The Premium Plan.</b> &mdash; The Premium Plan is thus
described by Mr. Halsey &mdash; "The time required to do a given
piece of work is determined from previous experience, and the
workman, in addition to his usual daily wages, is offered a premium
for every hour by which he reduces that time on future work, the
amount of the premium being less than his rate of wages. Making the
hourly premium less than the hourly wages is the foundation stone
upon which rest all the merits of the system."</p>
<p><b>Dr. Taylor's Description of This Plan.</b> &mdash; Dr. Taylor
comments upon this plan as follows:</p>
<p>"The Towne-Halsey plan consists in recording the quickest time
in which a job has been done, and fixing this as a standard. If the
workman succeeds in doing the job in a shorter time, he is still
paid his same wages per hour for the time he works on the job, and,
in addition, is given a premium for having worked faster,
consisting of from one-quarter to one-half the difference between
the wages earned and the wages originally paid when the job was
done in standard time," Dr. Taylor's discussion of this plan will
be found in "Shop Management," paragraphs 79 to 91.</p>
<p>Psychologically, the defect of this system undoubtedly is that
it does not rest upon accurate scientific time study, therefore
neither management nor men can predict accurately what is going to
happen. Not being able to predict, they are unable to devote their
entire attention to the work in hand, and the result
<!--Page 296--><a name="P296" id="P296"></a> cannot be as
satisfactory as under an assigned task, based upon time study. The
discussion of this is so thorough in Dr. Taylor's work, and in Mr.
Halsey's work, that it is unnecessary to introduce more here.</p>
<p><b>Profit-sharing</b>. &mdash; Before turning to the methods of
compensation which are based upon the task, it might be well to
introduce here mention of "Co&ouml;peration," or "Profit-sharing,"
which, in its extreme form, usually means the sharing of the
profits from the business as a whole, among the men who do the
work. This is further discussed by Schloss, and also by Dr. Taylor
in paragraphs 32 to 35, in "A Piece Rate System"; also in "Shop
Management," quoting from the "Piece Rate System," paragraphs 73 to
77.</p>
<p><b>Objections to Profit-sharing</b>. &mdash; The objections, Dr.
Taylor says, to co&ouml;peration are, first in the fact that no
form of co&ouml;peration has been devised in which each individual
is allowed free scope for his personal ambition; second, in the
remoteness of the reward; third, in the unequitable division of the
profits. If each individual is not allowed free scope, one sees at
once that the entire advantage of individuality, and of personal
recognition, is omitted. If the reward is remote, we recognize that
its power diminishes very rapidly; and if there cannot be equitable
division of the profits, not only will the men ultimately not be
satisfied, but they will, after a short time, not even be satisfied
while they are working, because their minds will constantly be
distracted by the fact that the division will probably not be
equitable, <!--Page 297--><a name="P297" id="P297"></a> and also
by the fact that they will be trying to plan ways in which they can
get their proper share. Thus, not only in the ultimate outcome, but
also during the entire process, the work will slow up necessarily,
because the men can have no assurance either that the work itself,
or the output, have been scientifically determined.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Management Embodies Valuable Elements of
Profit-sharing</b>. &mdash; Scientific Management embodies the
valuable elements of profit-sharing, namely, the idea of
co&ouml;peration, and the idea that the workers should share in the
profit.</p>
<p>That the latter of these two is properly emphasized by
Scientific Management is not always understood by the workers. When
a worker is enabled to make three or four times as much output in a
day as he has been accustomed to, he may think that he is not
getting his full share of the "spoils" of increased efficiency,
unless he gets a proportionately increased rate of pay. It should,
therefore, be early made clear to him that the saving has been
caused by the actions of the management, quite as much as by the
increased efforts for productivity of the men. Furthermore, a part
of the savings must go to pay for the extra cost of maintaining the
standard conditions that make such output possible. The necessary
planners and teachers usually are sufficient as object-lessons to
convince the workers of the necessity of not giving all the extra
savings to the workers.</p>
<p>It is realized that approximately one third of the extra profits
from the savings must go to the employer, <!--Page 298--><a name=
"P298" id="P298"></a> about one third to the employ&eacute;s,
and the remainder for maintaining the system and carrying out
further investigations.</p>
<p>This once understood, the satisfaction that results from a
co&ouml;perative, profit-sharing type of management will be
enjoyed.</p>
<p>The five methods of compensation which are to follow are all
based upon the task, as laid down by Dr. Taylor; that is to say,
upon time study, and an exact knowledge by the man, and the
employers, of how much work can be done.</p>
<p><b>Differential Rate Piece Work the Ultimate Form of
Compensation.</b> &mdash; Dr. Taylor's method of compensation,
which is acknowledged by all thoroughly grounded in Scientific
Management to be the ultimate form of compensation where it can be
used, is called Differential Rate Piece Work. It is described in "A
Piece Rate System," paragraphs 50 to 52, as follows: &mdash;</p>
<p>"This consists, briefly, in paying a higher price per piece, or
per unit, or per job, if the work is done in the shortest possible
time and without imperfection, than is paid if the work takes a
longer time or is imperfectly done. To illustrate &mdash; suppose
20 units, or pieces, to be the largest amount of work of a certain
kind that can be done in a day. Under the differential rate system,
if a workman finishes 20 pieces per day, and all of these pieces
are perfect, he receives, say, 15 cents per piece, making his pay
for the day 15 times 20 = $3.00. If, however, he works too slowly
and turns out only, say 19 pieces, then instead of receiving 15
cents per piece he gets <!--Page 299--><a name="P299" id=
"P299"></a> only 12 cents per piece, making his pay for the day
12&times;19= $2.28, instead of $3.00 per day. If he succeeds in
finishing 20 pieces &mdash; some of which are imperfect &mdash;
then he should receive a still lower rate of pay, say 10&cent; or
5&cent; per piece, according to circumstances, making his pay for
the day $2.00 or only $1.00, instead of $3.00."</p>
<p><b>Advantages of This System.</b> &mdash; This system is founded
upon knowledge that for a large reward men will do a large amount
of work. The small compensation for a small amount of work &mdash;
and under this system the minimum compensation is a little below
the regular day's work &mdash; may lead men to exert themselves to
accomplish more work. This system appeals to the justice of the
men, in that it is more nearly an exact ratio of pay to
endeavor.</p>
<p><b>Task Work with a Bonus</b>. &mdash; The Task work with Bonus
system of compensation, which is the invention of Mr. H.L. Gantt,
is explained in "A Bonus System of Rewarding Labor," paper 923,
read before the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, December,
1901, by Mr. Gantt. This system is there described as follows:
&mdash;</p>
<p>"If the man follows his instructions and accomplishes all the
work laid out for him as constituting his proper task for the day,
he is paid a definite bonus in addition to the day rate which he
always gets. If, however, at the end of the day he has failed to
accomplish all of the work laid out, he does not get his bonus, but
simply his day rate." This system of compensation is explained more
fully in Chapter VI of Mr. Gantt's book, "Work, Wages and Profits,"
<!--Page 300--><a name="P300" id="P300"></a> where he explains
the modification now used by him in the bonus.</p>
<p><b>Advantages of Task Work with a Bonus.</b> &mdash; The
psychological advantage of the task with a Bonus is the fact that
the worker has the assurance of a living wage while learning, no
matter whether he succeeds in winning his bonus or not. In the last
analysis, it is "day rate" for the unskilled, and "piece rate" for
the skilled, and it naturally leads to a feeling of security in the
worker. Mr. Gantt has so admirably explained the advantages,
psychological as well as industrial, of his system, that it is
unnecessary to go farther, except to emphasize the fine feeling of
brotherhood which underlies the idea, and its expression.</p>
<p><b>The Differential Bonus System.</b> &mdash; The Differential
Bonus System of Compensation is the invention of Mr. Frederick A.
Parkhurst, and is described by him in his book "Applied Methods of
Scientific Management."</p>
<p>"The time the job should be done in is first determined by
analysis and time study. The bonus is then added above the day work
line. No bonus is paid until a definitely determined time is
realized. As the time is reduced, the bonus is increased."</p>
<p><b>Three Rate with Increased Rate System</b>. &mdash; The Three
Rate System of Compensation is the invention of Mr. Frank B.
Gilbreth and consists of day work, i.e., a day rate, or a flat
minimum rate, which all who are willing to work receive until they
can try themselves out; of a middle rate, which is given to the man
when he accomplishes the work with exactness
<!--Page 301--><a name="P301" id="P301"></a> of compliance to
prescribed motions, according to the requirements of his
instruction card; and of a high rate, which is paid to the man when
he not only accomplishes the task in accordance with the
instruction card, but also within the set time and of the
prescribed quality of finished work.</p>
<p><b>Advantage of This System.</b> &mdash; The advantage of this
is, first of all, that the man does not have to look forward so far
for some of his reward, as it comes to him just as soon as he has
shown himself able to do the prescribed methods required
accurately. The first extra reward is naturally a stimulus toward
winning the second extra reward. The middle rate is a stimulus to
endeavor to perform that method which will enable him easiest to
achieve the accomplishment of the task that pays the highest wage.
The day rate assures the man of a living wage. The middle rate pays
him a bonus for trying to learn. The high rate gives him a piece
rate when he is skilled.</p>
<p>Lastly, as the man can increase his output, with continued
experience, above that of the task, he receives a differential rate
piece on the excess quantity, this simply making an increasing
stimulus to exceed his previous best record.</p>
<p><b>All Task Systems Investigate Loss of Bonus.</b> &mdash; Under
all these bonus forms of wages, if the bonus is not gained the fact
is at once investigated, in order that the blame may rest where it
belongs. The blame may rest upon the workers, or it may be due to
the material, which may be defective, or different from standard;
it may be upon the supervision, or some fault of the management in
not supplying the material <!--Page 302--><a name="P302" id=
"P302"></a> in the proper quality, or sequence, or a bad
condition of tools or machinery; or upon the instruction card. The
fact that the missing of the bonus is investigated is an added
assurance to the workman that he is getting the "square deal," and
enlists his sympathy with these forms of bonus system, and his
desire to work under them. The fact that the management will
investigate also allows him to concentrate upon output, with no
worry as to the necessity of his investigating places where he has
fallen short.</p>
<p><b>Necessity for Workers Bearing This Loss.</b> &mdash; In any
case, whether the blame for losing the bonus is the worker's fault
directly or not, he loses his bonus. This, for two reasons; in the
first place, if he did not lose his bonus he would have no
incentive to try to discover flaws before delays occurred; he
would, otherwise, have an incentive to allow the material to pass
through his hands, defective or imperfect as the case might be.
This is very closely associated with the second reason, and that
is, that the bonus comes from the savings caused by the plan of
management, and that it is necessary that the workers as well as
the management shall see that everything possible tends to increase
the saving. It is only as the worker feels that his bonus is a part
of the saving, that he recognizes the justice of his receiving it,
that it is in no wise a gift to him, simply his proper share,
accorded not by any system of philanthropy, or so-called welfare
work, but simply because his own personal work has made it possible
for the management to hand back his share to him.</p>
<!--Page 303--><a name="P303" id="P303"></a>
<p><b>Users of Any Task System Appreciate Other Task Systems.</b>
&mdash; It is of great importance to the workers that the users of
any of these five methods of compensation of Scientific Management
are all ready and glad to acknowledge the worth of all these
systems. In many works more than one, in some all, of these systems
of payment may be in use. Far from this resulting in confusion, it
simply leads to the understanding that whatever is best in the
particular situation should be used. It also leads to a feeling of
stability everywhere, as a man who has worked under any of these
systems founded on time study can easily pass to another. There is
also a great gain here in the doing away of industrial warfare.</p>
<p><b>Shorter Hours and Holidays Effective Rewards.</b> &mdash;
Probably the greatest incentive, next to promotion and more pay,
are shorter hours and holidays. In some cases, the shorter hours,
or holidays, have proven even more attractive to the worker than
the increase of pay. In Shop Management, paragraph 165, Dr. Taylor
describes a case where children working were obliged to turn their
entire pay envelopes over to their parents. To them, there was no
particular incentive in getting more money, but, when the task was
assigned, if they were allowed to go as soon as their task was
completed, the output was accomplished in a great deal shorter
time. Another case where shorter hours were successfully tried, was
in an office where the girls were allowed the entire Saturday every
two weeks, if the work was accomplished within a set amount of
time. This extra time for shopping and matinees proved more
attractive <!--Page 304--><a name="P304" id="P304"></a> than any
reasonable amount of extra pay that could be offered.</p>
<p><b>Desire for Approbation an Incentive.</b> &mdash; Under
"Individuality" were discussed various devices for developing the
individuality of the man, such as his picture over a good output or
record. These all act as rewards or incentives. How successful they
would be, depends largely upon the temperament of the man and the
sort of work that is to be done. In all classes of society, among
all sorts of people, there is the type that loves approbation. This
type will be appealed to more by a device which allows others to
see what has been done than by almost anything else. As to what
this device must be, depends on the intelligence of the man.</p>
<p><b>Necessity for Co&ouml;peration a Strong Incentive.</b>
&mdash; Under Scientific Management, many workers are forced by
their coworkers to try to earn their bonuses, as "falling down on"
tasks, and therefore schedules, may force them to lose their
bonuses also.</p>
<p>The fact that, in many kinds of work, a man falling below his
task will prevent his fellows from working, is often a strong
incentive to that man to make better speed. For example, on a
certain construction job in Canada, the teamsters were shown that,
by their work, they were cutting down working opportunities for
cart loaders, who could only be hired as the teamsters hauled
sufficient loads to keep them busy.</p>
<p><b>Value of Knowledge Gained an Incentive to a Few Only.</b>
&mdash; Extra knowledge, and the better method of attack learned
under Scientific Management, are rewards that will be appreciated
by those of superior <!--Page 305--><a name="P305" id=
"P305"></a> intelligence only. They will, in a way, be
appreciated by all, because it will be realized that, through what
is learned, more pay or promotion is received, but the fact that
this extra knowledge, and better method of attack, will enable one
to do better in all lines, not simply in the line at which one is
working, and will render one's life more full and rich, will be
appreciated only by those of a wide experience.</p>
<p><b>Acquired Professional Standing a Powerful Incentive.</b>
&mdash; Just as the success of the worker under Scientific
Management assures such admiration by his fellow-workers as will
serve as an incentive toward further success, so the professional
standing attained by success in Scientific Management acts as an
incentive to those in more responsible positions.</p>
<p>As soon as it is recognized that Scientific Management furnishes
the only real measure of efficiency, its close relationship to
professional standing will be recognized, and the reward which it
can offer in this line will be more fully appreciated.</p>
<p><b>Punishments Negative and Positive.</b> &mdash; Punishments
may be first negative, that is, simply a loss of promised rewards.
Such punishments, especially in cases of men who have once had the
reward, usually will act as the necessary stimulus to further
activity. Punishments may also be positive, such things as fines,
assignment to less pleasant work, or as a last resort,
discharge.</p>
<p><b>Fines Never Accrue to the Management</b>. &mdash; Fines have
been a most successful mode of punishment under Scientific
Management. Under many of the old forms of management, the fines
were turned back <!--Page 306--><a name="P306" id="P306"></a> to
the management itself, thus raising a spirit of animosity in the
men, who felt that everything that they suffered was a gain to
those over them. Under Scientific Management all fines are used in
some way for the benefit of the men themselves. All fines should be
used for some benefit fund, or turned into the insurance fund. The
fines, as has been said, are determined solely by the
disciplinarian, who is disinterested in the disposition of the
funds thus collected. As the fines do not in any way benefit the
management, and in fact rather hurt the management in that the men
who pay them, no matter where they are applied, must feel more or
less discouraged, it is, naturally, for the benefit of the
management that there shall be as few fines as possible. Both
management and men realize this, which leads to industrial peace,
and also leads the managers, the functional foremen, and in fact
every one, to eliminate the necessity and cause for fines to as
great an extent as is possible.</p>
<p><b>Assignment to Less Pleasant Work Effective Punishment</b>.
&mdash; Assignment to less pleasant work is a very effective form
of discipline. It has many advantages which do not show on the
surface, The man may not really get a cut in pay, though his work
be changed, and thus the damage he receives is in no wise to his
purse, but simply to his feeling of pride. In the meantime, he is
gaining a wider experience of the business, so that even the worst
disadvantage has its bright side.</p>
<p><b>Discharge To Be Avoided Wherever Possible.</b> &mdash;
Discharge is, of course, available under Scientific Management, as
under all other forms, but it is really <!--Page 307--><a name=
"P307" id="P307"></a> less used under Scientific Management than
under any other sort, because if a man is possibly available, and
in any way trained, it is better to do almost anything to teach
him, to assign him to different work, to try and find his
possibilities, than to let him go, and have all that teaching
wasted as far as the organization which has taught it is
concerned.</p>
<p><b>Discharge a Grave Injury to a Worker.</b> &mdash; Moreover,
Scientific Management realizes that discharge may be a grave injury
to a worker. As Mr. James M. Dodge, who has been most successful in
Scientific Management and is noted for his good work for his
fellow-men, eloquently pleads, in a paper on "The Spirit in Which
Scientific Management Should Be Approached," given before the
Conference on Scientific Management at Dartmouth College, October,
1911:</p>
<p>"It is a serious thing for a worker who has located his home
within reasonable proximity to his place of employment and with
proper regard for the schooling of his children, to have to seek
other employment and readjust his home affairs, with a loss of time
and wages. Proper management takes account not only of this fact,
but also of the fact that there is a distinct loss to the employer
when an old and experienced employ&eacute; is replaced by a new
man, who must be educated in the methods of the establishment. An
old employ&eacute; has, in his experience, a potential value that
should not be lightly disregarded, and there should be in case of
dismissal the soundest of reasons, in which personal prejudice or
temporary mental condition of the foreman should play no part.</p>
<!--Page 308--><a name="P308" id="P308"></a>
<p>"Constant changing of employ&eacute;s is not wholesome for any
establishment, and the sudden discovery by a foreman that a man who
has been employed for a year or more is 'no good' is often a
reflection on the foreman, and more often still, is wholly untrue.
All working men, unless they develop intemperate or dishonest
habits, have desirable value in them, and the conserving and
increasing of their value is a duty which should be assumed by
their superiors."</p>
<p><b>Punishment Can Never Be Entirely Abolished.</b> &mdash; It
might be asked why punishments are needed at all under this system;
that is, why positive punishments are needed. Why not merely a lack
of reward for the slight offenses, and a discharge if it gets too
bad? It must be remembered, however, that the punishments are
needed to insure a proper appreciation of the reward. If there is
no negative side, the beauty of the reward will never be realized;
the man who has once suffered by having his pay cut for something
which he has done wrong, will be more than ready to keep up to the
standard. In the second place, unless individuals are punished, the
rights of other individuals will, necessarily, be encroached upon.
When it is considered that under Scientific Management the man who
gives the punishment is the disinterested disciplinarian, that the
punishment is made exactly appropriate to the offense, and that no
advantage from it comes to any one except the men themselves, it
can be understood that the psychological basis is such as to make a
punishment rather an incentive than a detriment.</p>
<p><b>Direct Incentives Numerous and Powerful.</b> &mdash; As
<!--Page 309--><a name="P309" id="P309"></a> for the direct
incentives, these are so many that it is possible to enumerate only
a few. For example &mdash;</p>
<p>This may be simply a result of love of speed, love of play, or
love of activity, or it may be, in the case of a man running a
machine, not so much for the love of the activity as for a love of
seeing things progress rapidly. There is a love of contest which
has been thoroughly discussed under "Athletic Contests," which
results in racing, and in all the pleasures of competition.</p>
<p><b>Racing Directed Under Scientific Management.</b> &mdash; The
psychology of the race under Scientific Management is most
interesting. The race is not a device of Scientific Management to
speed up the worker, any speed that would be demanded by Scientific
Management beyond the task-speed would be an unscientific thing. On
the other hand, it is not the scope of Scientific Management to bar
out any contests which would not be for the ultimate harm of the
workers. Such interference would hamper individuality; would make
the workers feel that they were restricted and held down. While the
workers are, under Scientific Management, supposed to be under the
supervision of some one who can see that the work is only such as
they can do and continuously thrive, any such interference as, for
example, stopping a harmless race, would at once make them feel
that their individual initiative was absolutely destroyed. It is
not the desire of Scientific Management to do anything of that
sort, but rather to use every possible means to make the worker
feel that his initiative is being conserved.</p>
<p><b>All "Native Reactions" Act as Incentives.</b> &mdash; Pride,
<!--Page 310--><a name="P310" id="P310"></a> self-confidence,
pugnacity, &mdash; all the "native reactions" utilized by teaching
serve as direct incentives.</p>
<p><b>Results of Incentives to the Work.</b> &mdash; All incentives
in every form of management, tend, from their very nature, to
increase output. When Scientific Management is introduced, there is
selection of such incentives as will produce greatest amount of
specified output, and the results can be predicted.</p>
<p><b>Results of Incentives to the Worker.</b> &mdash; Under
Traditional Management the incentives are usually such that the
worker is likely to overwork himself if he allows himself to be
driven by the incentive. This results in bodily exhaustion. So,
also, the anxiety that accompanies an unstandardized incentive
leads to mental exhaustion. With the introduction of Transitory
Management, danger from both these types of exhaustion is removed.
The incentive is so modified that it is instantly subject to
judgment as to its ultimate value.</p>
<p>Scientific Management makes the incentives stronger than they
are under any other type, partly by removing sources of worry,
waste and hesitation, partly by determining the ratio of incentive
to output. The worker under such incentives gains in bodily and
mental poise and security.</p>

<h3><a name="chapterx" id="chapterx">CHAPTER X</a></h3>
<h3>WELFARE</h3>
<p><b>Definition of Welfare.</b> &mdash; "Welfare" means "a state
or condition of doing well; prosperous or satisfactory course or
relation; exemption from evil;" in other words, well-being. This is
the primary meaning of the word. But, to-day, it is used so often
as an adjective, to describe work which is being attempted for the
good of industrial workers, that any use of the word welfare has
that fringe of meaning to it.</p>
<p><b>"Welfare" Here Includes Two Meanings.</b> &mdash; In the
discussion of welfare in this chapter, both meanings of the word
will be included. "Welfare" under each form of management will be
discussed, first, as meaning the outcome to the men of the type of
management itself; and second, as discussing the sort of welfare
work which is used under that form of management.</p>
<p><b>Discussion of First Answers. Three Questions.</b> &mdash; A
discussion of welfare as the result of work divides itself
naturally into three parts, or three questions:</p>
<p class="ltritem">What is the effect upon the physical life?</p>
<p class="ltritem">What is the effect upon the mental life?</p>
<p class="ltritem">What is the effect upon the moral life?</p>
<p><b>Under Traditional Management No Physical Improvement.</b>
&mdash; The indefiniteness of Traditional Management
<!--Page 312--><a name="P312" id="P312"></a> manifests itself
again in this discussion, it being almost impossible to make any
general statement which could not be controverted by particular
examples; but it is safe to say that in general, under Traditional
Management, there is not a definite physical improvement in the
average worker. In the first place, there is no provision for
regularity in the work. The planning not being done ahead, the man
has absolutely no way of knowing exactly what he will be called
upon to do. There being no measure of fatigue, he has no means of
knowing whether he can go to work the second part of the day, say,
with anything like the efficiency with which he could go to work in
the first part of the day. There being no standard, the amount of
work which he can turn out must vary according as the tools,
machinery and equipment are in proper condition, and the material
supplies his needs.</p>
<p><b>No Good Habits Necessarily Formed.</b> &mdash; In the second
place, under Traditional Management there are no excellent habits
necessarily formed. The man is left to do fairly as he pleases, if
only the general outcome be considered sufficient by those over
him. There may be a physical development on his part, if the work
be of a kind which can develop him, or which he likes to such an
extent that he is willing to do enough of it to develop him
physically; this liking may come through the play element, or
through the love of work, or through the love of contest, or
through some other desire for activity, but it is not provided for
scientifically, and the outcome cannot be exactly predicted.
Therefore, under Traditional Management <!--Page 313--><a name=
"P313" id="P313"></a> there is no way of knowing that good
health and increased strength will result from the work, and we
know that in many cases poor health and depleted strength have been
the outcome of the work. We may say then fairly, as far as physical
improvement is concerned that, though it might be the outcome of
Traditional Management, it was rather in spite of Traditional
Management, in the sense at least that the management had nothing
to do with it, and had absolutely no way of providing for it. The
moment that it was provided for in any systematic way, the
Traditional Management vanished.</p>
<p><b>No Directed Mental Development.</b> &mdash; Second, mental
development. Here, again, there being no fixed habits, no specially
trained habit of attention, no standard, there was no way of
knowing that the man's mind was improving. Naturally, all minds
improve merely with experience. Experience must be gathered in, and
must be embodied into judgment. There is absolutely no way of
estimating what the average need in this line would be, it varies
so much with the temperament of the man. Again, it would usually be
a thing that the man himself was responsible for, and not the
management, certainly not the management in any impersonal sense.
Some one man over an individual worker might be largely responsible
for improving him intellectually. If this were so, it would be
because of the temperament of the over-man, or because of his
friendly desire to impart a mental stimulus; seldom, if ever,
because the management provided for its being imparted. Thus, there
was absolutely no way of predicting that wider or deeper
<!--Page 314--><a name="P314" id="P314"></a> interest, or that
increased mental capacity, would take place.</p>
<p><b>Moral Development Doubtful.</b> &mdash; As for moral
development, in the average Traditional Management it was not only
not provided for, but rather doubtful. A man had very little chance
to develop real, personal responsibilities, in that there was
always some one over him who was watching him, who disciplined him
and corrected him, who handed in the reports for him, with the
result that he was in a very slight sense a free agent. Only men
higher up, the foremen and the superintendents could obtain real
development from personal responsibilities. Neither was there much
development of responsibility for others, in the sense of being
responsible for personal development of others. Having no accurate
standards to judge by, there was little or no possibility of
appreciation of the relative standing of the men, either by the
individual of himself, or by others of his ability. The man could
be admired for his strength, or his skill, but not for his real
efficiency, as measured in any satisfactory way. The management
taught self-control in the most rudimentary way, or not at all.
There was no distinct goal for the average man, neither was there
any distinct way to arrive at such a goal; it was simply a case,
with the man lower down, of making good for any one day and getting
that day's pay. In the more enlightened forms of Traditional
Management, a chance for promotion was always fairly sure, but the
moment that the line of promotion became assured, we may say that
Traditional Management had really ceased, and
<!--Page 315--><a name="P315" id="P315"></a> some form of
Transitory Management was in operation.</p>
<p><b>"Square Deal" Lacking.</b> &mdash; Perhaps the worst lack
under Traditional Management is the lack of the "square deal." In
the first place, even the most efficient worker under this form of
management was not sure of his place. This not only meant worry on
his part, which distracted his attention from what he did, but
meant a wrong attitude all along the line. He had absolutely no way
of knowing that, even though he did his best, the man over him, in
anger, or because of some entirely ulterior thing, might not
discharge him, put him in a lower position. So also the custom of
spying, the only sort of inspection recognized under Traditional
Management of the most elementary form, led to a feeling on the
men's part that they were being constantly watched on the sly, and
to an inability to concentrate. This brought about an inability to
feel really honest, for being constantly under suspicion is enough
to poison even one's own opinion of one's integrity. Again, being
at the beck and call of a prejudiced foreman who was all-powerful,
and having no assured protection from the whims of such a man, the
worker was obliged, practically for self-protection, to try to
conciliate the foremen by methods of assuming merits that are
obvious, on the surface. He ingratiates himself in the favor of the
foreman in that way best adapted to the peculiarities of the
character of the foreman, sometimes joining societies, or the
church of the foreman, sometimes helping him elect some political
candidate or relative; at other times, by the more direct method
<!--Page 316--><a name="P316" id="P316"></a> of buying drinks,
or taking up a subscription for presenting the foreman with a gold
watch, "in appreciation of his fairness to all;" sometimes by
consistently losing at cards or other games of chance. When it is
considered that this same foreman was probably, at the time,
enjoying a brutal feeling of power, it is no wonder that no sense
of confidence of the "square deal" could develop. There are
countless ways that the brutal enjoyment of power could be
exercised by the man in a foreman's position. As has already been
said, some men prefer promotion to a position of power more than
anything else. Nearly all desire promotion to power for the extra
money that it brings, and occasionally, a man will be found who
loves the power, although unconsciously, for the pleasure he
obtains in lording over other human beings. This quality is present
more or less in all human beings. It is particularly strong in the
savage, who likes to torture captured human beings and animals, and
perhaps the greatest test for high qualifications of character and
gentleness is that of having power over other human beings without
unnecessarily accenting the difference in the situation. Under
Military Management, there is practically no limit to this power,
the management being satisfied if the foreman gets the work out of
the men, and the men having practically no one to appeal to, and
being obliged to receive their punishment always from the hands of
a prejudiced party.</p>
<p><b>Little Possibility of Development of Will.</b> &mdash; Being
under such influence as this, there is little or no possibility of
the development of an intelligent will. The <!--Page 317--><a name=
"P317" id="P317"></a> "will to do" becomes stunted, unless the
pay is large enough to lead the man to be willing to undergo abuses
in order to get the money. There is nothing, moreover, in the
aspect of the management itself to lead the man to have a feeling
of confidence either in himself, or in the management, and to have
that moral poise which will make him wish to advance.</p>
<p><b>Real Capacity Not Increased.</b> &mdash; With the likelihood
of suspicion, hate and jealousy arising, and with constant
preparations for conflict, of which the average union and
employers' association is the embodiment, naturally, real capacity
is not increased, but is rather decreased, under this form of
management, and we may ascribe this to three faults:</p>
<p>First, to lack of recognition of individuality, &mdash; men are
handled mostly as gangs, and personality is sunk.</p>
<p>Second, to lack of standardization, and to lack of time study,
that fundamental of all standardization, which leads to absolute
inability to make a measured, and therefore scientific judgment,
and</p>
<p>Third, to the lack of teaching; to the lack of all
constructiveness.</p>
<p>These three lacks, then, constitute a strong reason why
Traditional Management does not add to the welfare of the men.</p>
<p><b>Little Systematized Welfare Work Under Traditional
Management.</b> &mdash; As for welfare work, &mdash; that is, work
which the employers themselves plan to benefit the men, if under
such work be included timely impulses of the management for the
men, and the carrying of these out in a more or less systematic
way, it will be true to say that such welfare work has existed
<!--Page 318--><a name="P318" id="P318"></a> in all times, and
under all forms of management. The kind-hearted man will show his
kind heart wherever he is, but it is likewise true to say that
little systematic beneficial work is done under what we have
defined as Traditional Management.</p>
<p><b>Definite Statements as to Welfare Under Transitory Management
Difficult To Make.</b> &mdash; It is almost impossible to give any
statement as to the general welfare of workers under Transitory
Management, because, from the very nature of the case, Transitory
Management is constantly changing. In the discussion of the various
chapters, and in showing how individuality, functionalization,
measurement, and so on, were introduced, and the psychological
effect upon the men of their being introduced, welfare was more or
less unsystematically considered. In turning to the discussion
under Scientific Management and showing how welfare is the result
of Scientific Management and is incorporated in it, much as to its
growth will be included.</p>
<p><b>Welfare Work Under Transitory Management Is Usually
Commendable.</b> &mdash; As to the welfare work under Transitory
Management, much could be said, and much has been said and written.
Typical Welfare Work under Transitory Management deserves nothing
but praise. It is the result of the dedication of many beautiful
lives to a beautiful cause. It consists of such work as building
rest rooms for the employ&eacute;s, in providing for amusements, in
providing for better working conditions, in helping to better
living conditions, in providing for some sort of a welfare worker
who can talk with the employ&eacute;s and benefit
<!--Page 319--><a name="P319" id="P319"></a> them in every way,
including being their representative in speaking with the
management.</p>
<p><b>An Underlying Flaw Is Apparent.</b> &mdash; There can be no
doubt that an enormous quantity of good has been done by this
welfare work, both positively, to the employ&eacute;s themselves,
and indirectly, to the management, through fostering a kinder
feeling. There is, however, a flaw to be found in the underlying
principles of this welfare work as introduced in Transitory
Management, and that is that it takes on more or less the aspect of
a charity, and is so regarded both by the employ&eacute;s and by
the employer. The employer, naturally, prides himself more or less
upon doing something which is good, and the employ&eacute;
naturally resents more or less having something given to him as a
sort of charity which he feels his by right.</p>
<p><b>Its Effect Is Detrimental.</b> &mdash; The psychological
significance of this is very great. The employer, feeling that he
has bestowed a gift, is, naturally, rather chagrined to find it is
received either as a right, or with a feeling of resentment.
Therefore, he is often led to decrease what he might otherwise do,
for it is only an unusual and a very high type of mind that can be
satisfied simply with the doing of the good act, without the return
of gratitude. On the other hand, the employ&eacute;, if he be a man
of pride, may resent charity even in such a general form as this,
and may, with an element of rightness, prefer that the money to be
expended be put into his pay envelope, instead. If it is simply a
case of better working conditions, something that improves him as
an efficient <!--Page 320--><a name="P320" id="P320"></a> worker
for the management, he will feel that this welfare work is in no
sense something which he receives as a gift, but rather something
which is his right, and which benefits the employer exactly as
much, if not more than it benefits him.</p>
<p><b>Welfare Work Not Self-perpetuating.</b> &mdash; Another fault
which can be found with the actual administration of the welfare
work, is the fact that it often disregards one of the fundamental
principles of Scientific Management, in that the welfare workers
themselves do not train enough people to follow in their footsteps,
and thus make welfare self-perpetuating.</p>
<p>In one case which the writer has in mind, a noble woman is
devoting her life to the welfare of a body of employ&eacute;s in an
industry which greatly requires such work. The work which she is
doing is undoubtedly benefiting these people in every aspect, not
only of their business but of their home lives, but it is also true
that should she be obliged to give up the work, or be suddenly
called away, the work would practically fall to pieces. It is built
up upon her personality, and, wonderful as it is, its basis must be
recognized as unscientific and temporary.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Provision for Welfare Under Scientific
Management.</b> &mdash; Under Scientific Management general welfare
is provided for by: &mdash;</p>
<p>The effect that the work has on physical improvement. This we
shall discuss under three headings &mdash;</p>
<p>1. the regularity of the work.</p>
<p>2. habits.</p>
<p>3. physical development.</p>
<!--Page 321--><a name="P321" id="P321"></a>
<p>As for the regularity of the work &mdash; we have</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) The apportionment of the work and the rest.
Under Scientific Management, work time and rest time are
scientifically apportioned. This means that the man is able to come
to each task with the same amount of strength, and that from his
work he gains habits of regularity.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) The laying out of the work. The standards
upon which the instruction cards are based, and the method of
preparing them, assure regularity.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(c) The manner of performing the work. Every
time that identical work is done, it is done in an identical
manner.</p>
<p>The resulting regularity has an excellent effect upon the
physical welfare of the worker.</p>
<p>2. Habits, under Scientific Management,</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) are prescribed by standards. The various
physical habits of the man, the motions that are used, having all
been timed and then standardized, the worker acquires physical
habits that are fixed.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) are taught; <a href=
"#ch10fn01"><sup>1</sup></a> therefore they are not remote but come
actually and promptly into the consciousness and into the action of
the worker.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(c) are retained, because they are standard
habits and because the rewards which are given for using them make
it an object to the worker to retain them.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(d) Are re&euml;nforced by individuality and
functionalization; <!--Page 322--><a name="P322" id="P322"></a>
that is to say, the worker is considered as an individual, and his
possibilities are studied, before he is put into the work;
therefore, his own individuality and his own particular function
naturally re&euml;nforce those habits which he is taught to form.
These habits, being scientifically derived, add to physical
improvement.</p>
<p>3. Physical development</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) is fostered through the play element, has
been scientifically studied, and is utilized as far as possible;
the same is true of the love of work, which is re&euml;nforced by
the fact that the man has been placed where he will have the most
love for his work.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) is insured by the love of contest, which is
provided for not only by contest with others, but by the constant
contest of the worker with his own previous records. When he does
exceed these records he utilizes powers which it is for his good
physically, as well as otherwise, to utilize.</p>
<p><b>Results of Physical Improvement.</b> &mdash; This regularity,
good habits, and physical development, result in good health,
increased strength and a better appearance. To these three results
all scientific managers testify. An excellent example of this is
found in Mr. Gantt's "Work, Wages and Profits," where the increased
health, the better color and the better general appearance of the
workers under Scientific Management is commented on as well as the
fact that they <!--Page 323--><a name="P323" id="P323"></a> are
inspired by their habits to dress themselves better and in every
way to become of a higher type. <a href=
"#ch10fn02"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Mental Development.</b> &mdash; Welfare under Scientific
Management is provided for by Mental Development. This we may
discuss under habits, and under general mental development.</p>
<p>1. As for habits we must consider</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) Habits of attention. Under Scientific
Management, as we have shown, attention must become a habit. Only
when it does become a habit, can the work required be properly
performed, and the reward received. As only those who show
themselves capable of really receiving the reward are considered to
be properly placed, ultimately all who remain at work under
Scientific Management must attain this habit of attention.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) Habit of method of attack. This not only
enables the worker to do the things that he is assigned
satisfactorily, but also has the broadening effect of teaching him
how to do other things, i.e., showing him the "how" of doing
things, and giving him standards which are the outcome of mental
habits, and by which he learns to measure.</p>
<p>2. General mental development is provided for by the experience
which the worker gets not only in the general way in which all who
work must give experience, but in the set way provided for by
Scientific Management. This is so presented to the worker
<!--Page 324--><a name="P324" id="P324"></a> that it becomes
actually usable at once. This not only allows him to judge others,
but provides for self-knowledge, which is one of the most valuable
of all of the outcomes of Scientific Management. He becomes
mentally capable of estimating his own powers and predicting what
he himself is capable of doing. The outcome of this mental
development is</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) wider interest.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) deeper interest.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(c) increased mental capabilities.</p>
<p>The better method of attack would necessarily provide for wider
interest. The fact that any subject taken up is in its ultimate
final unit form, would certainly lead to deeper interest; and the
exercise of these two faculties leads to increased mental
capabilities.</p>
<p><b>Moral Development.</b> &mdash; Moral development under
Scientific Management results from the provisions made for
cultivating &mdash;</p>
<p class="ltritem">1. personal responsibility.</p>
<p class="ltritem">2. responsibility for others.</p>
<p class="ltritem">3. appreciation of standing.</p>
<p class="ltritem">4. self-control.</p>
<p class="ltritem">5. "squareness."</p>
<p>1. Personal responsibility is developed by</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) Individual recognition. When the worker was
considered merely as one of a gang, it was very easy for him to
shift responsibilities upon others. When he knows that he is
regarded by the management, and by his mates, as an individual,
that what he does will show up in an individual record, and will
receive individual reward or punishment, <!--Page 325--><a name=
"P325" id="P325"></a> necessarily personal responsibility is
developed.</p>
<p>Moreover, this individual recognition is brought to his mind by
his being expected to fill out his own instruction card. In this
way, his personal responsibility is specifically brought home to
him.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) The appreciation which comes under
Scientific Management. This appreciation takes the form of reward
and promotion, and of the regard of his fellow-workers; therefore,
being a growing thing, as it is under Scientific Management, it
insures that his personal responsibility, shall also be a growing
thing, and become greater the longer he works under Scientific
Management.</p>
<p>2. Responsibility for others is provided for by the
inter-relation of all functions. It is not necessary that all
workers under Scientific Management should understand all about it.
However, many do understand, and the more that they do understand,
the more they realize that everybody working under Scientific
Management is more or less dependent upon everybody else. Every
worker must feel this, more or less, when he realizes that there
are eight functional bosses over him, who are closely related to
him, on whom he is dependent, and who are more or less dependent
upon him. The very fact that the planning is separated from the
performing, means that more men are directly interested in any one
piece of work; in fact, that every individual piece of work that is
done is in some way a bond between a great number of men, some of
whom are planning and some <!--Page 326--><a name="P326" id=
"P326"></a> of whom are performing it. This responsibility for
others is made even more close in the dependent bonuses which are a
part of Scientific Management, a man's pay being dependent upon the
work of those who are working under him. Certainly, nothing could
bring the fact more closely to the attention of each and every
worker under this system, than associating it with the pay
envelope.</p>
<p>3. Appreciation of standing is fostered by</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) individual records. Through these the
individual himself knows what he has done, his fellows know, and
the management knows.</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) comparative records, which show even those
who might not make the comparison, exactly how each worker stands,
with relation to his mates, or with relation to his past
records.</p>
<p>This appreciation of standing is well exemplified in the happy
phrasing of Mr. Gantt &mdash; "There is in every workroom a
fashion, or habit of work, and the new worker follows that fashion,
for it isn't respectable not to. The man or woman who ignores
fashion does not get much pleasure from associating with those that
follow it, and the new member consequently tries to fall in with
the sentiment of the community. <a href=
"#ch10fn03"><sup>3</sup></a> Our chart shows that the stronger the
sentiment in favor of industry is, the harder the new member tries
and the sooner he succeeds."</p>
<p>4. Self-control is developed by</p>
<p class="ltritem">(a) the habits of inhibition fostered by
Scientific Management, &mdash; that is to say, when the
<!--Page 327--><a name="P327" id="P327"></a> right habits are
formed, necessarily many wrong habits are eliminated. It becomes a
part of Scientific Management to inhibit all inattention and wrong
habits, and to concentrate upon the things desired. This is further
aided by</p>
<p class="ltritem">(b) the distinct goal and the distinct task
which Scientific Management gives, which allow the man to hold
himself well in control, to keep his poise and to advance
steadily.</p>
<p>5. "Squareness." This squareness is exemplified first of all by
the attitude of the management. It provides, in every way, that the
men are given a "square deal," in that the tasks assigned are of
the proper size, and that the reward that is given is of the proper
dimensions, and is assured. This has already been shown to be
exemplified in many characteristics of Scientific Management, and
more especially in the inspection and in the disciplining.</p>
<p><b>Moral Development Results in Contentment, Brotherhood and the
"Will To Do".</b> &mdash; The three results of this moral
development are</p>
<p class="ltritem">1. contentment</p>
<p class="ltritem">2. brotherhood</p>
<p class="ltritem">3. a "will to do."</p>
<p>1. Contentment is the outgrowth of the personal responsibility,
the appreciation of standing, and the general "squareness" of the
entire plan of Scientific Management.</p>
<p>2. The idea of brotherhood is fostered particularly through the
responsibility for others, through the feeling that grows up that
each man is dependent <!--Page 328--><a name="P328" id=
"P328"></a> upon all others, and that it is necessary for every
man to train up another man to take his place before he can be
advanced. Thus it comes about that the old caste life, which so
often grew up under Traditional Management, becomes abolished, and
there ensues a feeling that it is possible for any man to grow up
into any other man's place. The tug-of-war attitude of the
management and men is transformed into the attitude of a band of
soldiers scaling a wall. Not only is the worker pulled up, but he
is also forced up from the bottom. <a href=
"#ch10fn04"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>3. The "will to do" is so fostered by Scientific Management that
not only is the worker given every incentive, but he, personally,
becomes inspired with this great desire for activity, which is
after all the best and finest thing that any system of work can
give to him.</p>
<p><b>Interrelation of Physical, Mental and Moral Development.</b>
&mdash; As to the interrelation of physical, mental and moral
development, it must never be forgotten that the mind and the body
must be studied together, <a href="#ch10fn05"><sup>5</sup></a> and
that this is particularly true in considering the mind in
management. <a href="#ch10fn06"><sup>6</sup></a> For the best
results of the mind, the body must be cared for, and provided for,
fully as much as must the mind, or the best results from the mind
will not, and cannot, be obtained.</p>
<!--Page 329--><a name="P329" id="P329"></a>
<p>Successful management must consider the results of all mental
states upon the health, happiness and prosperity of the worker, and
the quality, quantity and cost of the output. That is to say,
unless the mind is kept in the right state, with the elimination of
worry, the body cannot do its best work, and, in the same way,
unless the body is kept up to the proper standard, the mind cannot
develop. Therefore, a really good system of management must
consider not only these things separately, but in their
interrelation, &mdash; and this Scientific Management does.</p>
<p><b>Result of Physical, Mental and Moral Development Is Increased
Capacity.</b> &mdash; The ultimate result of all this physical
improvement, mental development and moral development is increased
capacity, increased capacity not only for work, but for health, and
for life in general.</p>
<p><b>Welfare Work an Integral Part of Scientific Management.</b>
&mdash; Strictly speaking, under Scientific Management, there
should be no necessity for a special department of Welfare Work. It
should be so incorporated in Scientific Management that it is not
to be distinguished. Here the men are looked out for in such a way
under the operation of Scientific Management itself that there is
no necessity for a special welfare worker. This is not to say that
the value of personality will disappear under Scientific
Management, and that it may not be necessary in some cases to
provide for nurses, for physical directors, and for advisers. It
will, however, be understood that the entire footing of these
people is changed under Scientific Management. It is realized under
Scientific <!--Page 330--><a name="P330" id="P330"></a>
Management that these people, and their work, benefit the employers
as much as the employ&eacute;s. They must go on the regular payroll
as a part of the efficiency equipment. The workers must understand
that there is absolutely no feeling of charity, or of gift, in
having them; that they add to the perfectness of the entire
establishment.</p>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p><b>Results of Welfare to the Work.</b> &mdash; Because of
Welfare Work, of whatever type, more and better work is
accomplished, with only such expenditure of effort as is beneficial
to the worker. Not only does the amount of work done increase, but
it also tends to become constant, after it has reached its standard
expected volume.</p>
<p><b>Result of Welfare Work to the Worker.</b> &mdash; This
description of welfare of the men under Scientific Management, in
every sense of the word welfare, has been very poor and incomplete
if from it the reader has not deduced the fact that Scientific
Management enables the worker not only to lead a fuller life in his
work, but also outside his work; that it furnishes him hours enough
free from the work to develop such things as the work cannot
develop; that it furnishes him with health and interest enough to
go into his leisure hours with a power to develop himself there;
that it furnishes him with a broader outlook, and, best of all,
with a capacity of judging for himself what he needs most to get.
In other words, if Scientific Management is what it claims to be,
it leads to the development of a fuller life in every sense of the
<!--Page 331--><a name="P331" id="P331"></a> word, enabling the
man to become a better individual in himself, and a better member
of his community. If it does not do this it is not truly Scientific
Management. Miss Edith Wyatt has said, very beautifully, at the
close of her book, "Making Both Ends Meet" <a href=
"#ch10fn07"><sup>7</sup></a>: "No finer dream was ever dreamed than
that the industry by which the nation lives, should be so managed
as to secure for the men and women engaged in it their real
prosperity, their best use of their highest powers. How far
Scientific Management will go toward realizing the magnificent
dream in the future, will be determined by the greatness of spirit
and the executive genius with which its principles are sustained by
all the people interested in its inauguration, the employers, the
workers and the engineers."</p>
<p>We wish to modify the word "dream" to the word "plan." The plan
of Scientific Management is right, and, as Miss Wyatt says, is but
waiting for us to fulfill the details that are laid out before
us.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion.</b> &mdash; The results thus far attained by
Scientific Management justify a prediction as to its future. It
will accomplish two great works.</p>
<p>1. It will educate the worker to the point where workers will be
fitted to work, and to live.</p>
<p>2. It will aid the cause of Industrial Peace.</p>
<p>It will put the great power of knowledge into every man's hands.
This it must do, as it is founded on co&ouml;peration, and this
co&ouml;peration demands that all shall know and shall be
taught.</p>
<p>With this knowledge will come ability to understand
<!--Page 332--><a name="P332" id="P332"></a> the rights of
others as well as one's own. "To know all is to pardon all."</p>
<p>Necessity for co&ouml;peration, and trained minds: &mdash; These
two can but lead to elimination of that most wasteful of all
warfare &mdash; Industrial Warfare. Such will be the future of
Scientific Management, &mdash; whether it win universal approval,
universal disapproval, or half-hearted advocacy to-day.</p>
<p>When the day shall come that the ultimate benefits of Scientific
Management are realized and enjoyed, depends on both the managers
and the workers of the country; but, in the last analysis, the
greatest power towards hastening the day lies in the hands of the
workers.</p>
<p>To them Scientific Management would desire to appeal as a road
up and out from industrial monotony and industrial turmoil. There
are many roads that lead to progress. This road leads straightest
and surest, &mdash; and we can but hope that the workers of all
lands, and of our land in particular, will not wait till necessity
drives, but will lead the way to that true "Brotherhood" which may
some day come to be.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
