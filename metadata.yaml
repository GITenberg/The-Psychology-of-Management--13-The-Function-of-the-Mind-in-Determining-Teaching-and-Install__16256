description: "The Psychology of Management: The Function of the Mind in Determining,\
  \ Teaching, and Installing Methods of Least Waste is a book written by Lillian Gilbreth\
  \ which investigates the psychological aspects of scientific management, incorporating\
  \ concepts of human relations and worker individuality into management principles.\
  \ Published in 1914, it is a major early work in the field of industrial psychology\
  \ and scientific management. A contemporary book review reflects early resistance\
  \ to scientific management, stating the book \"does not answer the really important\
  \ questions about the effect of standardized work upon the worker\".\nIn this book,\
  \ Gilbreth defines \"the psychology of management\" as \"the effect of the mind\
  \ that is directing work upon that work which is directed, and the effect of this\
  \ undirected and directed work upon the mind of the worker.\" She expresses the\
  \ view that scientific management is \"built on the principle of recognition of\
  \ the individual, not only as an economic unit but as a personality\", stressing\
  \ the importance of including the \"human element\" in management, which was lacking\
  \ in the prevailing form of Taylorism at the time. It was also the first time that\
  \ basic elements of management theory were brought together, including \"(1) knowledge\
  \ of individual behavior, (2) the theory of groups, (3) the theory of communication,\
  \ and (4) a rational basis for decision making\".\nThis book was originally Gilbreth's\
  \ unpublished dissertation for a doctorate from the University of California; however,\
  \ since the university refused to grant her the degree due to her noncompliance\
  \ with residency requirements, she instead opted to publish it. It was originally\
  \ serialized during 1912-1913 in Industrial Engineering and Engineering Digest,\
  \ before it was published in book form in 1914.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
